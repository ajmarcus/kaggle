"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng has overcome an obstacle in her life and that she is learning to move on. In the story Saeng is often stuck on past memories rather than making new ones. For example, when Saeng goes to the florist shop to purchase the plant, she starts remembering old memories from her homeland. When she sees the plant labeled jasmine, she thinks of her grandmother that died and remembers how she used to put jasmine blossoms in her hair. Also, she tells her mother that the hibiscus she bought is not a real one and she also says its not like the kind we had before. @CAPS1, she keeps comparing her new life to her old life in her homeland and she does not allow her new experiences to be as good as her old ones. @CAPS1 when the author concludes the story with that paragraph, it shows growth in the girl, Saeng, and that she is willing to move on and make new memories, such as trying to pass her driving test again."
