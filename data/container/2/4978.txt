"Multiple parts of the setting effect the cyclist; When he arrives in a town with a water pump, but this pump doesn’t have good water, “when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid“ (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This part of terrain shows its effect. When he becomes very dehydrated, “in my dehydrated state“ (kurmaskie @NUM1). Another part of the setting that effected the cyclist was when he arrived at the juice factory and it was closed which depressed him."
