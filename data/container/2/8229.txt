"on paragraph @NUM1 in the article it say's ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" I think that the mood the auther is creating in the memoir is happyness because Narciso is very geatful to his parents."
