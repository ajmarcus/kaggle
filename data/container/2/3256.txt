"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One example is that by adding the dirigible, it would add stress to the building. The frame of the Empire State Building would have to be changed due to the pressure that would be put on the building. All of the changes that would have to be made would add up to over sixty thousand dollars. Now, there would also be 102 floors. The top floor would be the boarding area as well as an observation area. One more thing they had done for the mooring masts was raise an American flag on top. All of these accommodations were made for the help of dirigibles docking on top of the Empire State building."
