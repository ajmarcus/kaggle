The mood in the memoir is happy and thankful. I think this because the memoir is talking about how this boy apreshiates that his parents moved just so he can have a better life. I know this because in the last paragraph the boy talks about his family and how he will never forget how his parents turned a simple house to a home. So thats the mood of the memoir.
