"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by @PERSON1 he writes mainly about how grateful he is for everything he grew up with and is truly the mood created by the author. Narciso is grateful for his cuban culture and how it was incorperated into his life growing up even though he was in New Jersey. He is also grateful for his parents and the sacrafices they made for him in order to grow up in @LOCATION2. His parents also taught him to be kind to everyone, and treat everyone like family. He is grateful for that."
