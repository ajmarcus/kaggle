"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was ""the fact that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) That would make it hard for the dirigibles to be tethered to the mast. Annother problem they faced was the ""existing laws against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) Also the equipment used to to dock the airships haden't even been installed."
