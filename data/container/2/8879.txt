"The mood created in this memoir was manily for me family and Love. for most of the memoir the author was talking about exprens he had in the house, and the love he had's for his family and frend's. The first example I have for the mood is when he say's ""as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."". This shows the parents love for the kids. a second example I have is for family when the reading say's ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great senst that ""family"". and he is talking about thy are all so close nit. This reading was a good example of a closs nit comunity and of parent scracise. for they kid's."
