"In the story, @ORGANIZATION1, by Minfong Ho the aurthe concluldes the story with the last paragraph because he's trying to say when the flower comes back to life and starts a new beginning that Saeng will start a new beginning by retaking the test. For example, ÒLook how root - bound it is, poor thing"". The example is saying how the plant was almost died when she bought it. Another example would be, ""I-I failed the test"". The example tells how she feels down about failing the test. So In @CAPS1 the flower was at it's Òbreaking point"" as well as saeng. The paragraph tells how @CAPS2 was going to take a break and wait for the flower to being stronger till she toke the test again."
