"In the @CAPS1, Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates afeeling of family, home and culture. ""Created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This quote shows that Narciso and his family had a great understanding and gratefulness for their culture. The @CAPS1 says that they opened the door to any one who came in and they always shared dinner with family. That shows the close-knit family @CAPS2 grew up in. Narciso tells how his parents turned a house into a home."
