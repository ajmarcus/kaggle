"The author concludes the paragraph with a statement that Saeng said. It was a very good statement. The author ended with this to show that she is motivated and determined to do this. She shows she is motivated in many ways. she says, “Here let me help you mother.” This shows that she is motivated by helping her mother finish what she started. She is also determined by saying, “almost reluctantly she realizes that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through a quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familier now.” This shows that she wants to do something and she doesn’t think it is weird anymore. That is why the author concludes that statement."
