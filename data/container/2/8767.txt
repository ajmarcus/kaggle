"The mood created by the author of the memoir is a mellow, unintense and subdued almost sad mood emphesized by the hardships the Rodriguez family (parents) faced in their struggle to give their children a better life. Although slightly depressing, the mood is happy and in a way, cheerful when the author describes how kind and welcoming the Rodriguez family is in paragraph four. But, the memoir create the depressing mood in paragraph @NUM1 due to the explinations of the families struggles in moving to @LOCATION1 and what they had to give up in order to selflessely better their childrens life.Over all, between the cheerful mood of the memoir and the sad mood of the memoir, the memoir generates a mellow, calm and serene mood throughout the article."
