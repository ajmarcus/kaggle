"The author created a mood of immense gratefulness. The author knows that not every family (Cuban or possibly @CAPS1) can all get together and be truly happy and grateful for what they have. Not every family can work well with everyone else. Not every family can have the satisfaction of sharing and giving to others. This is a feeling of gratefulness because of the parents. The authors consistantly praises them on their courageous acts, and even going against the law to help those in need. The parens brought such happiness by welcoming those who are different and sharing happiness with them. The author had an incredible experience and is eternally grateful for having such wonderful parents that she had."
