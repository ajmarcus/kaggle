"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. The author explaines how happy @CAPS1 was living in his cuban home. The mood is also grateful. The author is grateful that his parents left their homes and left everything behind to give a better life to their kids. The author states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author is happy that @CAPS1 had a real family. @CAPS1 was happy for the simple house they had and was grateful. The author says in paragraph five, ""In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find."" @CAPS1 is grateful that his parents struggled just to make life easier or better for their children. Those are what I think the moods are created by the author."
