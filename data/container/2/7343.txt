"Before reading about @PERSON1 I don't think I read about anyone who is more happy than @PERSON1. @PERSON1 is very happy about being an @CAPS1 citizen and still be very happy of having another country's background (in this case Cuba). @PERSON1 was blessed that he had his house. It was in a great neighborhood and the kitchen was the main place of the house. @PERSON1 was very proud of where he lived even though his house was not a mansion or even close to a big house. @PERSON1 was very happy about his parents, most of all. Without his parents he would have lived in Cuba and would not have known his great neighborhood and all of his family and friends."
