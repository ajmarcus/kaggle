"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it symbolizes the change in Saeng as well as other things. The snow always melts when the seasons change. The geese always come back when the seasons change. The hibiscus will bud when the seasons change. Saeng will try again when the seasons change. But shell be a different person also. Knowing that everything will change but stay the same on the inside, Saeng decides she will too. She has more of an appreciation for @CAPS1 now after seeing the hibiscus and remembering her past."
