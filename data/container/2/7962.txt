"The @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2 is different and uneek to other I have heard. I belive that the @CAPS1 the @CAPS3 is trying to make is happyness, and selflessness, and grateful. I think this because he describes his parents As selflessness and takes everyone in to theire small Apartment. I also think he is creating ""warth"" by saying that his first birthday with his parent Are comfortting That is the @CAPS1 I belive the @CAPS3 is trying to create. "
