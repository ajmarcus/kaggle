"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock thousands of feet above the New York streets. One of their many problems was the sheer size of the dirigibles, somewhere as long as one-thousand feet. Another problem they faced was keeping the back of the ship from swiveling around the mooring mast. Usually, the backs of these blimp-like structure's were anchored down by lead weights, but to have lead weights dangling high above the streets was way to risky not to mention unpractical."
