"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one that is used in lots of memoirs because they are like thing's: someone will never forget like the author said ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally gratefull). Passionate cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. That's all stuff that he will never forget."
