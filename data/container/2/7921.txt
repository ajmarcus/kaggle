"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez the mood is calm and they are happy. I think this because they talk mainly about the good thing in their childhood. They also say how much they loved thier family. If you don't love or have a family as a child you would not be happ and they were. My last reason is they were most grateful for their home and how their parent turned a house into a home. This is why I think the authors mood is happy and calm."
