The story I just read was inspiring. I relized that your true blooded family isnt only your family theres other people that you can bond with and after a little while you can become family according to how close. The mood created my the author was happy. It was happy because everything he said in this story was true and it made me feel lucky to have such a great family and freiends that I call family.
