"The last sentence of a story is usually the most meaningfull. I believe the author ended the story this way for many reasons. For example, I think the author did this to leave the reader with a strong sense of determination. The story quotes, I will take that test again. By use of the word will, the author shows the girls determination. She didnt say she would try to, she said she will, without a doubt. I also think the author ended this way to emphasize the theme of new begginigs. The story quotes, when they come back... in the spring... I will take that test again. This shows that in spring, the new begginig of life she will take the test. This is why I believe the author ended the story this way."
