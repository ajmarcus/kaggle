"THE CYCLIST SETTINGS HINDER HIM IN THE ESSAY ÒROUGH ROAD AHEAD. THE CYCLIST IS IN THE DESERT IN THE SUMMER TIME WITH HARDLY ANY WATER. HE IS TRYING TO FIND HIS WAY TO YOSEMITE, BUT HE GETS LOST ALONG THE WAY BECAUSE SOME OLD MEN GAVE HIM BAD DIRECTIONS. DURING THIS TIME HE IS RIDING HIS BICYCLE FOR MILES AND MILES IN THE HEAT OF THE SUMMER. HIS THOUGHTS OF THIRST GET IN THE WAY OF HIM TRYING TO CONTINUE ON TO FIND YOSEMITE. I BELIEVE THAT IF THE CYCLIST WAS IN A COOLER ENVIRONMENT THEN THINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT BECAUSE HIS SETTINGS WERE SORT OF A DISTRATION TO HIM"
