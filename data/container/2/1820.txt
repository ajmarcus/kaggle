"In the excerpt, the Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, the construction of the Empire State Building faces many problems. One of these problems is that the governer of New York, Al Smith wanted the building to be the tallest in the world. In order to do this you would need a mask to break the record. The mask made to made nature a danger to the whole building because of violent air current. Another reason how the Empire State Building failed is because their was a law banning airships flying too low over urban areas. This law went in effect because of a German dirigible caught on fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Those were just some of the many problems the dirigibles faced while passing the Empire State Building."
