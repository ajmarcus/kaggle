"The last paragraph states in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again. I believe the author has ended with that paragraph to state the fact when her new home is like her old home maybe she will feel more confident and more in her place, instead of cold winter total opposite of where she use to live. The feeling of her old home, in her new home will make her more positive and comfortable. So then she will take the test feeling at home and pass."
