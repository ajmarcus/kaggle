"There was many different obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle faced was to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Another obstacle was that most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Those were some of the different obstacles they faced which caused the lack of success."
