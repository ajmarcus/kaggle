"In order to build the Empire State building, some Of the workers endured problems while constructing it. The engeineeres and architects consulted first with the experts. The obstacles the builders had to face were, one the height. It was a thousand feet and it was putting stress on the buildings frame. Wind pressure also added stress to the one thousand foot building. Another big obstacle was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting to the violent air currents. Even when the mooring mast was tethered or tied up the back part of the ship would sway from the wind. In the end the author says or implies that it was never meant to be built because of all the problems that came with it."
