"The mood created in the memoir is the feeling of Cuban culture and the @CAPS1's home. The feeling could be described as homey. In paragraph @NUM1, this is where the @CAPS1 first introduces the custom of his house. And how it is. The @CAPS1 describes his house as simple with cuban music and the scent of cuban food flowing through it. The feeling that the @CAPS1 uses to describe his house is the feeling that the whole memoir had. The house kinda flooded the memior with it's feelings. Also this memior didn't only show cuban feeling it also gave of family vibes (like how a family is happy and together) It expressed how the @CAPS1 was close to his family"
