"The mood created by the author in the memoir could be strong to many people once they put it together. Narciso's parents started of in a home that meant nothing. However, Narciso's parents turned it into something great. In the last sentence of the memoir Narciso states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. What he was trying to explain was your home is what you make of it. That is what I believe the mood created by the author in the memoir is."
