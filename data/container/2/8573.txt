"In the memoir, @PERSON1, the author creates a mood that inspires us to try our hardest and that mood is perseverence. The mood perseverence is expressed in the memoir in many ways. One way it is a stress is when @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1 moved to the United States and lived in a one bedroom apartment. They finally saved up enough money to be able to move into a @NUM1 bedroom apartment. In this neighborhood the family raise as much money as possible to buy food for themselves and to help the people that were in need of anything from, water, shelter, and clothing. The reason they move from Cuba was to begin a better life in the United States which they never gave up until the day that they finally had enough money to live here."
