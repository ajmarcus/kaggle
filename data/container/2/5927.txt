"The author of Winter Hibiscus concludes the story with  the excerpt ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again because it emphasizes Saeng pain to come to an unknown place and fail her first test but also emphasizes Saengs resolve to work hard after seeing a flower that resembled one from home. The flower itself is very important to Saeng, for example, the text reads And besides it was yet another old friend. a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers. This excerpt demonstrates Saengs love for her hometown through a flower that she knows grows back home. Another example is when Saeng told her mother the bad news I-I failed the test @CAPS1 attention instantly was drawn to the flower and her mother could only be good. In conclusion, the hibiscus flower is Saengs source of stength as its the only thing she knows in the united states. Saeng wants to show the same resolve on her test that the  flower shows in the harsh winter."
