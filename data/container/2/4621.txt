"In the story Do Not Exceed posted speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. We can tell because the author writes that road was replaced by short, rolling hills (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This tells us that cyclist is hard to ride on the road. The speed limit is also affect the cyclist. When the the speed limit sign is appear, the character feels life can feel so cruel (kurmaskie @NUM1). It tells us that character can not do what he is trying to do. The bad road and speed limit sigh effect the cyclist."
