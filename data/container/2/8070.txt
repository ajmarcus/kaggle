"In the excerpt from the memoir ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" by Narciso Rodriguez he has a specific mood or feeling throughout the whole excerpt. He mood seemed to be kind of like a happy mood that shows everything even the hard times like ""a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed the United States,"" in a happy tone or mood. He even explained how his parents left their country and friends to live here and have warre jobs in a lighter happier mood. I believe that Narciso Rodriguez likes to look at everything in a happy, light mood no matter what it is."
