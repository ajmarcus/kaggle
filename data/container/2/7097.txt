" The mood created by the author in this memoir was very loving and caring for their friends, family and everyone around them, for example it says how his mom would always keep the door open for whoever was going through a rough time or untill they were back on their feet because she knew they would do the same for her and her family. Also the mood is very thankful since Narciso admires everything that he's done in life and who he's helped out and he's thankful for all the friends he has and the care they have for him and his family and he thanks every oppertunity he gets in life. The mood also shows how that somthing small can turn out to be big on the inside because Narciso has done so much just from the small place he lives in."
