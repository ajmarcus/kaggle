"In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted, obstacles builders faced building a mast for dirigibles to dock there are detailed One obstacle builders faced was how to go about attaching it. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the buildings frame."" Another obstacle would be the accumulated cost of the renevisions due to the first problem. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings frame work."" These obstacles prevented the mast for ever being used its intended purpose."
