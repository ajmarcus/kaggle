"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with an interesting paragraph. The paragraph says” When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding  then I will take that test again. ""The author ended the story with that paragraph because she was not in her comfort zone, she had move to a new country and missed everything like the flower and the Hibiscus. So she would wait until she felt at home and comfortable again to retake the test. In the text it states “through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” She was realizing that it wasn’t so bad & she was getting used to it."
