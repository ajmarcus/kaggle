"The setting in the essay “Rough Road ahead; Do not Exceed the speed limit” affected the narrator in many ways. The first thing that affected his ride was the heat. at first he didnt really notice but then it began to slow him down. Then the ways of the roads began to affect his ride, the roads went from flat sheet to short, rolling hills.” The road change and the heat made him say “I could drop from heatstroke.” Then because of the old towns he went through he was unable to get water. The water pumps were so old and unused for so long that the water was of very poor quality."
