"The setting is the main factor on effects on the cycleist. The cycleist’s main problem is that he is low on water & dehydrated, “trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” The author wouldn’t have been so dehydrated if it weren’t so hot. Also, all the problems he faces are setting related like the snake & the rough road. If it would have taken place in a more mild area, there wouldn’t have been any conflicts."
