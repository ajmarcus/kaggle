"The setting is the main factor on effects on the cycleist. The cycleists main problem is that he is low on water & dehydrated, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The author wouldnt have been so dehydrated if it werent so hot. Also, all the problems he faces are setting related like the snake & the rough road. If it would have taken place in a more mild area, there wouldnt have been any conflicts."
