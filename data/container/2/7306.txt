"The mood created by the author was a very grateful and happy mood in his memoir. For an example in paragraph six he states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their Love and sacrifice."" This shows how grateful he is to his parents. He is also grateful to his friends and neighbors it states this in paragraph three when the author says ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This shows that Narciso Rodriguez is very neighborey and that his neighbors portray the same happy, grateful, and neighborely outlook. so all of these reasons explain the mood of Narciso Rodriguez."
