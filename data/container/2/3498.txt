"From the knowledge I gained reading the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" I lerned that there were many obstacles in making a place for dirigibles to dock. The most important reason is safety. Since most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, the dirigibles were highly flammable. If the dirigibles were to ever catch on fire over New York, many lives could be in danger. Another obstacle was the climate. The empire State buildings top where they were going to build the Mooring Mast, had such a bad climate it was nerly impossible to dock a dirigible on it. These are some of the many obstacles the architects had to face when designing the mooring mast."
