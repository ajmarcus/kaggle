A desert makes the heat unberable for the cyclist. Its just sun, sand, and him. Then it tells the month summer of course makes the temperatures for the cyclist about @NUM1 almost maybe even hotter. This could cause him to drink plenty of water and almost lose all of his water supply. “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.” Then there is the distance of his ride. The author is always saying “About @NUM2 miles” or “Twenty miles up the road.” All of this hard work can cause heatstroke & kill him."
