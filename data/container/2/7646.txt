"The mood created by the author in the memoir was the love your home and all of the people around it. The author is gratefull for all of the skills that her parents taught her like cooking, which she said that she was grateful for and also music. She loves to cook and listen to cuban music. She also loves all of the people around her home and how they all came together in unison even though they were all different cultures. She is grateful for all that her parents sacrificed to give her a better life. That is what I think was the mood of the memoir created by the author is."
