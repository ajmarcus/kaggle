"@CAPS2, memories, hard @CAPS1  All are reasons why the author conluds the story with this When They come back, saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is buddng, Then I will take the test again. First @CAPS2 because she failed her test first so it takes some guts and will power to go back and even try it again. Also because when she remember her grandmother it upsets her so that definatly takes @CAPS2 and the human will power to do her test a second time. Next memories. I @CAPS4 she keeps wanting to do this test because she has had so many good memories with her grandmother and doesnt want to ever forget them. But again goes back to the will power or the want to, to go back and do the test a second time. Last All the Hard @CAPS1. All the Hard @CAPS1 because She knows what her grandmother  ment to her and threw all the things or Hard @CAPS1 that her grandmother put out she saw and wants to honaor or apreciate all of the stuff that her grandmother did for her. These are the reasons that @CAPS3 @CAPS4 the author ended with that Paragraph rather than some other paragraph"
