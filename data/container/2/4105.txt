"In the story the setting has a large affect on the cyclist. After taking advice from old people he ended up in the desert with no cars, buildings, or peopl. He was running low on water and had no way of getting anymore, and he was really dehydrated, he got really tired and almost gave up because of the heat and lack of water. All this was caused by the setting he was in."
