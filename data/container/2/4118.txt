"The setting affected the cyclist greatly throughout his ride. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke (pG @NUM1 kurmaskie). This quote is saying that because of the heat, the rough terrain and the length of his shortcut his running out of water. Thats when he realizes he could die from heatstroke because he listened to a bunch of old men."
