"The feature of the setting affected the cyclist, because as his surrondings changed he lost hope of making it to Yosemite National park. Such as when he was riding through his first town and it looked abandoned he wasnt so sure if he shold keep going. As well as when he didnt see anyone or any buildings he got worried and was wanting to lose hope. But  as second road sign appeared he was relieved."
