"The author created a mood of happiness and love. When Narciso Rodriguez was thinking back to the past he loved his home and his parents for what they did for him. The way, he lived was the mood of his house. It was free and welcoming. Just as the way his parents were to other immigrants. Narciso Rodriguez's cubian home was one of the most important things he cared about and grateful for."
