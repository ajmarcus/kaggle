"In this essay features of the setting affect the cyclist in his journey to get to Yosemite makes it worse. Firts for example the cyclist was in the high deserts of California in the heat of June. Which makes it bad because of the heat makes it harder on the cyclist. Also being in the deserts there wasn’t any watwer supply so after the cyclist ran out of water it got worse because he got dyhigerated, and caused him to become weaker and not pedal as fast. Also the author says that the tarren changes from flat roads, to short rolling hills, which also made it more difficult because the short hills made it more work, and since it was so hot and he didn’t have water he couldn’t funcation as well as if he was hydrated."
