"On the cyclist way to Yosemite National Park, he is given directions from a group of old men, but their direction arent so good. The desserted place affected him because there was no where for him to stop and eat or refill his water bottle There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. There were rusted water pumps, with hot water, but nothing to cool him down. His surroundings led him to the state of dehydration."
