"I think the Author ends this as the concluding sentence because it symbolize’s how the girl presecive things. The girl means when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding it means that it is going to be warm again, @CAPS1 means when it is warm again it brings her spirit up because it reminds her of her homeland. I think by her being remind of her homeland would help her take the test easier because she will be more happy. @CAPS1 I think will help her do better on the test. For example, the author said in the story that the flower bring her comfort @CAPS1 I think being comfortable is the best way to succeed and pass the test. In conclusion I think the author ends the story like that because he wanted the readers to understand a connection with the girl and her homeland, and how flower comfort her."
