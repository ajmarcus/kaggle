"In the story the cyclist faced many problems, one of the biggest problems was the terrian that he had to maneuver them. The terrain was hilly, having to go up a hill on a bike is tireing and wears you out faster than flat land would, and making him use more energy. The heat was also unbearable making it harder for him to focus, the cyclist did everything he could to keep consiese while  manuvering threu the terrain and deserted landscape being a huge desert of rolling mountains he pushed forwad, finding no civilization anywhere to get a refill of water. For example, if the terrain wasn’t as hilled then it would of made it easier for him using less energy and less strain on his legs, the heat of the desert beating down on him probably slowed his progress also. Heat will make you move slower and a cyclist moving down a  barnest road with no shade will make the journey seem longer, and imposible. In the end his will and determination got with threw the landscape, so he could get the water he needed to finish his trip"
