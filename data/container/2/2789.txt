"The builders of the Empire State Building faced some problems allowing the dirigibles to dock there. One of the problems was that they didn't really have landing gear. It was very hard to land a dirigibles on the ground, but in mid air it was almost impossible. Another reason was it was very unsafe. The pilot of the dirigibles would have to land it about @NUM1 feet in the sky and if they messed up they could potentially die. Another reason was that there was a law against airships from from flying low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for people to land it up there. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems when trying to make a dock for dirigibles."
