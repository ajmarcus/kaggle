"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon LŸsted the builders faced obstacles such as how the dirigibles would stay tied to the mast. They weren't sure as to how they would keep the dirigible from swiveling from air currents. As said in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's framework."" Another problem faced was the use of hydrogen in the dirigibles made them highly flammable."
