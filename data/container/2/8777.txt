"The mood Narciso Rodriguez creates is gratefullness. When I read this, I feel thankful like the author. Although his family had a good life in Cuba, they left to give their kids a better life. @CAPS1 the author's family hadn't left Cuba, I think the mood would be different. Then the author wouldn't think his parents were selfless (for that reason, anyway) @CAPS1 my parents did that for my siblings and me, I would want people to feel grateful as well. @PERSON1 understands how hard it was for his parents. Another mood could be guilt. I feel guilty when I read this because I don't always thank my parents or apreciate them. Narciso Rodriguez created a lot of moods in the memoir."
