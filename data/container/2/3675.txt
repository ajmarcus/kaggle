"The setting and features affect the cyclist because with each building he hopes for water, but since he is traveling through a desert water is in limited supply and many empty buildings are left out in the wastland. These buildings create a feeling of releve in the cyclist anty to be followed by despair to find them abandoned. The land with no features also creates a feeling of lost hope in the rider making his entire ordeal that much harder. Over all it was an excureiatly experience physicly and mentaly for the cyclists."
