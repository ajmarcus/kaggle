"The features in the setting greatly affect the cyclist, the setting was hot and rough terrain and he was tired and thirsty. The cyclist said, over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. He this means that he needed water so much and the hill was so big that he needed water. Also he says, Summertime rattled around in the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain. It is summer time where he is riding and to keep his mind off of his thirst, he hums the song summertime He wants to show that the heat cannot overtake his body. Also he says, At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. He is saying that the terrain is deadly because of the snake that passed by him. He needed to show with all objections, he could overcome anything. As you can see the setting greatly affected the cyclist."
