"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the excerpt from ""Home: The blueprints of our lives, is very thankFul. ""and for which I am eternally grateful"" ""I will always be grateful to my parents"" @CAPS1 like these that are scattered thro-ugh out the excerpt show greatfulness, and love for his parents. Some other @CAPS1 like ""They came selflessly"" and ""... To give their children a better life"". Throughout the excerpt he tries to express how greatful he is to his parents, and community. One quote that can to mind when reading paragraphs @NUM1 & @NUM2 is ""It takes a village to raise a child"" I think thats how @ORGANIZATION1's community worked. They weren't just neighbors, they were family."
