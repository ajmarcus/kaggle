"In the short story the cyclist was affected by the setting in many ways. The author was running out of water throughout the whole story. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. There was a limited amount of water in the bottles. He had to travel a long distance. Not two miles into the next section. He was getting tired quick. Also the terrain was not good. I noticed the terrain changing, flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. It get harder and harder to continue his ride."
