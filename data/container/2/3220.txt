"In the excerpt, ""the mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted, the builders of the empire State building faced some obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obsticle was that in order to build it for docking dirigibles, they had to spend over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework. Also, another obsticle was because of the safety. Dirigibles were not that safe, they were flameable and would be over an area with many other buildings and people around. Those are a few obsticles that the builders of the empire State building faced in attempting to allow the docking of dirigibles."
