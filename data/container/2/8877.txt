"The mood created by the author is loving and happy for many reasons. It is loving because Narciso really loves his family and is grateful for his parents for giving up there lives, to give him a better one, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" It is happy because the overall memoir is about family and friends and good his child hood was. ""Growing up in the environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Those are the biggest moods that this memoir potrays."
