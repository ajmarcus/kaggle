"The character, Saeng, experiences both internal and external conflicts. Saeng had failed her drivers test and stilled missed Vietnam. The ending of the story was an excellent choice of conclusion for the story. The flock of @CAPS1 geese represented her changes. She used to foot awkward and out of places. Many things were new to her. Saeng realized that life isn't so bad for her. The planting of the winter hibiscus represented her change as well. It showed how she will start new and continue happily. Saeng will plant a new seed. The ending was well chosen for the story because it foreshadows Saengs future. The story is inspiring and the ending greatly contributes to the effect."
