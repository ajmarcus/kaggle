"The builders had to face many obstacles in attempting to allow dirgibles to dock at the empire state building but there were a couple main ones. The first main obstacle was that a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. So with that they could not put the mooring mast on top of the building yet until they did some major adjustments. With that big problem the builders next obstacle was to design and build a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless stell tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. The last little obstacle the builders had to face was that the mast also had a skeleton of steel and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows that had to be built and put up. Those were some of the obstacles the builders had to face while trying to put a mooring mast on to of the Empire State building."
