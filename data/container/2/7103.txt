"In the memoir, the author created a very upbeat mood. He clearly is very grateful for his family, and had a happy childhood. He pointed out the parts of his home and situation that could have been negitive for him while growing up, but then he cancelled those negitive things out by noting the positive aspects of each situation. For example, in the memoir he wrote about how his family had immigrated to the United States, and how they had good jobs in Cuba, but then had to start all over with low-paying jobs once they got here. He said that this was hard for them, but he found a positive way to look at the situation. He did this by writing about how his parent's situation taught them and him to always work hard, and never give up. So overall, he made what could have been a depressing story, have an upbeat and happy mode. He even made the story teach you a lesson about hard work and the importance of family and giving to others."
