"In this memoir, Narciso made the mood peaceful because he named the music that was playing and all the family that ate with them. Narciso also talked about them cooking. I think the moods peaceful because he doesn't say anything bad about his parents. he only says the good things about them. The mood could also be grateful because he was grateful for many things that his parents did for him such as pass down the love of culinary. He's also grateful for his parents leaving Cuba and @CAPS1 everything over again @CAPS2 that he could have a good job and a good life. Another possible mood can be warmth because Narciso loved his family and probably felt the warmth of everyone when they all went over his house."
