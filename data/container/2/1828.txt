"From the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, the architechs building the Empire state building faced many obstacles. in attempting to allow drigibles to dock there. An obstacle they faced in attempting to let the drigbles to dock there we're the winds. As it says in the excerpt, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around..."" The dirigible would not be stable. Another obstacle they faced was to weigh it down, they'd have to use lead weight but it wouldnt be ""practical nor safe"" dangling high above people in @LOCATION1 on the Street. Overall The architecs faced a lot of obstacles for docking the dirigibles, Most being either practical or not safe."
