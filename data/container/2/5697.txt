"Winter Hibiscus by @CAPS1 Ho explores one's quest for acceptance and adaptation to changes in life. Saeng is  the young in the story who is dealing with her recent move to america from her homeland in asia. after failing a test, Saeng spends an dosene amount of money on a flower. When she consoltes with her mother, Saeng silently vows something to herself. Saeng vows ""when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"". @CAPS1 Ho chose to end the story this way because the story represents the guest for adaptation. Single-handedly, Saeng was able to say a vow to herself that showed she had accepted her new foreign home of america, even though she will always remember her homeland."
