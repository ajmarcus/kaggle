"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted,to obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock where nature and the law against airships flying too low over urban areas.     The greatest obstacle builders faced was nature. ""The winds of the top of the building constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Also the back of the ships would force the dirigible to spin around from the forceful winds. Then using lead weights in the Empire State Building, they would be dangling high above people on the streets below and it is not safe.      The next obstacle is that a law existed against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made dirigibles illegal to fly over to the building."
