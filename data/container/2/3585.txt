"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a negative way. He was in the desert, which is dry and hot. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.""(Kurmaskie @NUM1). Also, the  temperature was hot and made every thing around him hot, “brackish water faling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). Since he was in the desert, there was no escape from the sun. The text  states, “The sun was beginning to beat down”(Kurmaskie @NUM3). The cyclist was all alone in the road with none around him either so into he passed out, no one could help him. “ and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgous day in June”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). ""About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ‘town’ but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town."" (Kurmaskie @NUM3). Thesettings that the cyclist was riding in wasn't good ones and so they negativly affected him; causing him to be dehydrated and tiredin the end."
