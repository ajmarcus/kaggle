"The cyclist ran into many issues in his/her travel to @LOCATION1. They had to dismiss many hardships such as lack of water, being lost, immense desert heat, plus minor things like snakes and road conditions. The setting of the California desert in June was the most intense hardship. That and the lack of water. Though the heat starting powing at the cyclists brain by making them see mirages, etc. The heat and entire setting made the cyclists travel much harder."
