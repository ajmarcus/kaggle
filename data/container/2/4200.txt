"In the story the features of setting affect the cyclist because there is not much he can depend on. For example, it is the desert and usually there is nothing there. The cyclist only has a limited supply of what he needs and riding through there does not help him. For example, the old men who gave him directions made him think he could make it longer before he could elgo. This affected him because throughout his journey his lack of water slowed him down and made him think he wasn`t going to make it. When he finally got to Gary & Wilbers fish camp, he learned a lesson because when an old man asked if he know the quickest route to Yosemite he said yes, I have a very good map.''"
