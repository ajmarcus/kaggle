"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in @CAPS1 ways. The cyclist was in California in June weather. If it wasnt so hot, he wouldnt have needed water as badly. He wouldnt have been sweating as much. Also, there werent any buildings or cars around, so there wasnt anyone to help him. There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structures of any kind. @CAPS1 features of the setting could affect the cyclist."
