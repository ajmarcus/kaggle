" Tisaeng had failed her drivers test after she went to ""flour is it and bought a plant it was the ""dok faeng  noi"", she had fond memories about the plant. She remembered it from Vietnam, and how it used to be everywhere all the time. She had bought @CAPS1 hibiscus as a comfort to herself. The  last paragraph says, When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. Saeng figured out that things happen for a reason and opportunities occur over and over again. Just as the geese go south and @CAPS2 as the seasons change. She had decided she will retake the test next time she gets a change."
