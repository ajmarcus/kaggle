The features of setting affect the cyclist in that a desert-like temperature and the terrain on which he must bike make him more prone to thirst and exhausting. The heat @MONTH1 cause the cyclist to dehydrate faster than normal. This is especially true in this case because of his lack of water. The cyclist might pass out or suffer a heat stroke. The terrain of rolling hills will tire out the cyclist quicker than if he were still on the flat road. His muscle will start to ocha and his body will need water and rest. The story would totaly change if the setting were different. If the cyclist were biking in the @DATE1 on a cold day in the mid @NUM1 he would not have a chance of suffering a heatstroke. There would be a significantly less chance of him becoming dehydrated. The setting is very important in every story and can change everything.
