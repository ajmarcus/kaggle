"The author of Winter Hibiscus purposely had that last paragraph in there. Honestly the story is better with it too. In the last paragraph when it says In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. @CAPS1 @NUM1. When the author write all those things in nature that will happen it symbolized re-birth and a fresh start, a new chance and that is what Saeng needs with her drivers license. The author put powerfully. Put those symbols in there to show hope for the girl to make it through her tough time. Finally, the story has a sense of roundness and end with that last paragraph, the story is complete."
