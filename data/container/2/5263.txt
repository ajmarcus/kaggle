"The feature in the short story affect the cyclist because with no towns around there is now water. In the story is says, The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. This means the cyclist was short on water and needed to find a town soon. Cycling in the desert and up down hills made it harder and hotter. The heart could cause dehydration or a heatstroke because it says, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke the buildings the cyclist did see were not any help to him because they had no water. Eventually he came to a fishing camp and found water in the sink of the bathroom. The story says, I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink. This is where the setting changes because the cyclist found cool water finally."
