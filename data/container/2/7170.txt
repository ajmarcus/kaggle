"In this memoir gives a grateful feeling. Some of the reasons I think this is because like in paragraph @NUM1. The author says ""our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuba, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevail in the United States."" But the main part of the story is that how he loves the neighborhood he lives in and the house he lives in and mostly how much the people are basically family in that neighborhood. And that is why I think the author has a grateful mood in the memoir."
