"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, there were obstacles that the builders of the Empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The majestic spire of the Empire State Building is familiar to many people throughout the world, but not many know that the original purpose of the mast was to serve as a landing spot For dirigibles also known as blimps. The builders of the Empire State building faced a myriad of obstacles. It is proven when it says ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building Flat Roof... A Thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable Tether, would add stress to the Buildings frame"". They took a risk in having the dirigibles tied to the Empire State building, which can cause pressure to the building which soon might clasp. Another @CAPS1 that proves that the builders Empire State faced, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature its self"" The winds on top of the building made it dangerous. clearly there were obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced."
