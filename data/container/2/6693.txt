"The story Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho,is about overcoming adversity. She concludes the story by writing when they come back [the geese] then I will take that test @NUM1). The main character, Saeng, had been having trouble at school and on her way home had seen an assortment of flowers that were indigenous to her homeland. Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense it was almost @NUM2) The sight of those flowers namely the hibiscus reminded her of what she lost and offered comfort in the face of the memory. The winter hibiscus could still survive even though it was not in the land where it belonged. Her mother states Its flowers arent as pretty but its strong enough. Thats what @NUM3). Saeng , after hearing this, decides that she could be strong, too, and would try to do her best in school. She would adapt just like the winter hibiscus."
