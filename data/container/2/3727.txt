Then as he realizes that he might have enough water his attitude changes. The cyclist goes from frustrated to loving the secenery, The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them, as the conditions changed to even more unbearable heat. He decided to just give up. Until he got courage and slowly gaining elevation while losing hope. When he saw Gary and Wilbers fish camp, he realized he was safe."
