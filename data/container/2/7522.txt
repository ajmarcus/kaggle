"The mood the author used in the memoir is showing how proud their family is. Narciso shows how greatful and proud she is that her parents would change cultures, language, and also find a new job so she could be born in @LOCATION1. The author also shows how close their family is. They have an extended family because they live with their grandparents. Narciso is very proud to live in the family she is, and grateful that her parents did all of that for her."
