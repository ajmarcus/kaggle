"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. It is showing all kinds of memories the family has at one house As it says in the memoir, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. It's saying that a house is a house and it doesn't mean much to people and anyone can go there. But a home is where you live, is where you grow up and have all the memories, it's just a better place"
