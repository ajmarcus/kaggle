"The features of the setting effected the cyclist very much. The text says, “The sun was beginning to beat down”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The hot sun was making the cyclist sweat. He was losing water. This was making him dehadrayted faster. The text says. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (Kurmaskie @NUM2). The hills the cyclist had to ride up were wearing him out. He was getting tierd faster. The text says. “I stubled into a rather modern in bathroom and drank deeply from the sink"" (Kurmaskie @NUM3). The modern bathroom had good, cold water. This allowed the cylist to drink from it. The water replenished the cyclist allowing him to regain some of his strength. Then the cyclist could carry on."
