"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez is an internationally recognized clothing designer. He talks about his hometown in Newark, New Jersey. In the memoir, he offers the true definition of ""family"". I felt like the mood was comforting, and loving, and heart-warming. Just by the way he talks about how much he loves his Cuban heritage, and how his mother and father immagrated from Cuba, to @LOCATION2, and how, even at a young age, they still managed to raise him, and do alot for him, and give him the best childhood they could give him, that he'll always remember. He also talks about how ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative"", meant that you could even consider someone not blood related to you, as your own flesh and blood, family."
