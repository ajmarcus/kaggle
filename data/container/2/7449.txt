"The @CAPS1 created by the auther is that in paragraph @NUM1 it States that ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home. It was verry heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwitting pakd onto me their rich culinary Skills and a love a cooking that is still with me today."" I think this relats to the @CAPS1 of the memoir because living in @LOCATION1 you could Still have a house and life stile like you were Still living back where you live, in this case in Cuba."""
