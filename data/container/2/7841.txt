"From the memoir Home: Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a mood of gratitude and love. The author's gratitude is to his parents for their cultural and selflessness for leaving their family and friends so their kids could have a better life. one line that really showed this was ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on a love of cooking that is still with me today"" (@NUM1). That line shows how much he loves his culture and heritage. He loves his Cuban family with all their traditions. I'm aware of this because of a line ""Passionate Cuban Music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" (@NUM1). Narciso Rodriguez is constantly creating a mood of gratitude and love in his memoir."
