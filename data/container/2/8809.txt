"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a very satisfactory mood. The author uses a satisfactory tone, too, especially when the author is explaining what a family is. Near the end of the memoir it has a very satisfactory mood, partly because it is near the end and they are ending the memoir, and also it is explaining what a family is. The mood of the memoir is also interesting because the author uses information of Narciso Rodriguez's life to help explain what a family is. The mood created by the author in the memoir is very satisfactory and interesting."
