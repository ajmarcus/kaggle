"The features of the setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie show that as the day goes on the cyclist becomes tired and wornout from his long ride through rough terrain trying to find his way back home then he saw some buildings down a hill and said “With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill” (kurmakie @NUM1). After the rider gets home he says he is going to do it again."
