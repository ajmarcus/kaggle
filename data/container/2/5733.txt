"In the story Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho the author concluded the story with a paragraph that showed feeling. The paragraph showed that the girl Saeng was determined to pass the test, For example the text states the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. It shows that even though she failed it once she isnt going to let that stop her. The girl also expresses somewhat how she feels about the geese and the plant. For example the text states when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding. It shows that she doesnt regret buying the hibiscus.  "
