"The mooring mast on the Empire State Building was intentionally built for dirigible docking. Although the problem with allowing that to happen was not questioned at the time of the mast's construction, safety issues were a major concern. Most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen gas, which is extremely flamable. The news of the German dirigible Hindenburg being destroyed in flames greatly concerned the owners of the Empire State Building. They imagined how much more worse that would be if a dirigible combusted on the building and in a dense population of Downtown New York. This caused the builders of the Empire State Building to reconsider allowing dirigibles dock at it's mooring mast."
