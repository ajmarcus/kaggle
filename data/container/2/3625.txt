"The setting in the story discouraged the biker very much. As he follows the advice of the elderly men and starts off his journey he notices that there is, Òno one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.Ó He uses tone words to describe how had things are when he says, ÒThe water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.Ó He describes in exhaust how hard his journey is getting. He describes the intense heat inthe desert of California, pedaling up, Ò one long, crippling hill.Ó The terrain did not make his rideeasy at all. The factor of weather, rolling hills, and the shortage of water take a tall on him. If he were on flat terrain on a cool day then he would have been first fine."
