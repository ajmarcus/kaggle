"Most of the obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building had were due to weather. If New York ever had a windy day the dirigible would pull at the mast. The mast is attached to the ""@CAPS1"" of the building, and it might affect the frames or ""@CAPS1"" of the building. Another reason is the danger it would bring to all of New York. If a dirigible ever hit something or something went wrong the dirigible would @CAPS3 on top of New York. With all the trafic of New York you would most likly not want a burning dirigible falling overhead."
