"The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist is running out of water and is in the intense heat in the high deserts of California in June. The tumbleweeds that cross his path add to the desperation. Not only do the features of the setting affect the cyclist physically by dehydrating him in the heat, but also mentally. The cyclist encounters rolling hills, tumbleweeds rattle snakes and ghost towns. All of these make the cyclist start to give up hope. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist physically and mentally."
