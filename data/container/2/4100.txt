"The second photograph better communicates ideas similar to the ideas expressed in the essay “A sea worry “, because the story is about a boy who surfs as a job & in the second picture a boy is surfing. The author says “my son body-surfs. He says it’s his “job”. That quote was explaining that he’s a body-surfer & it’s his occupation. This is the reason I chose the secod photograph."
