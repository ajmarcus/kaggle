"The second photograph better communicates ideas similar to the ideas expressed in the essay A sea worry , because the story is about a boy who surfs as a job & in the second picture a boy is surfing. The author says my son body-surfs. He says its his job. That quote was explaining that hes a body-surfer & its his occupation. This is the reason I chose the secod photograph."
