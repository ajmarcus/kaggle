"I think the mood of the passage @ORGANIZATION1 by The Blueprints of our Lives is a very @CAPS1 mood because in the passage it @CAPS6 ""I've thanked them repeatedly"" I believe this meas that @CAPS2 is thank full that her parents provided him/her with a good home. Another reason I think that the mood of the @CAPS3 is @CAPS1 because in the story the @CAPS3 @CAPS6 ""I will never forget new my parents turned his Simple house into a home I think this means that the @CAPS3 is @CAPS8 and that is the mood I believe the article is about."
