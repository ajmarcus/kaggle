There were many obstacles that builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there One obstacle was the wind. At higher elevation the wind is much more powerful. This would make it very difficult to accually get the dirigible close to the mast. Also the structure of of Empire State Building. The framework was not built for the amount of weight that would be on top of the building. Builders made over @MONEY1 worth of fortifying the framework.
