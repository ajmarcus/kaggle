"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist from the essay ÒDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, Òby Joe Kurmaskie had many obsticales to over come. When he first showed the old men his map he was probably thinking to himself, Ò@CAPS1 my gosh, what did I get myself into?!Ó Because the cyclist trusted the shortcut the old men told him about he had a lot of doubt, anger and determination later on during the day. It was really hot and he was running out of water making him worried he was going to get dehydrated and die because he was starting to think he was getting lost. The hills also affected the cyclist by making him tired. In conclusion, the cyclist, in the end, found a little store by all the determination and effort he put in."
