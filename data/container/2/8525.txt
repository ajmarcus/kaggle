"The mood created by the author in this memoir is peaceful and loving. Narciso really believes that the definition of home is relationships & love rather than furniture and expenses. His home sounds really great because the way it is described in the memoir, you can see that his family are very caring and selfless people. The fact that his parents take in strangers and allow them to stay at their home really shows that they are very caring people."
