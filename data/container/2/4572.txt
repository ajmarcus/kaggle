"The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. Fem the ghost town to the bait shop, it was all a challenge for him. A misleading challenge , But a challenge . In the desert is were water grew short and he tried everything to push himself. From staring at the horizon to get to a place to another from sucking on pebble stone to not focus on water. And when he arrive at the bait shop. A sense of relief came to him, like that shop was his safe haven. But yet he would never get directions from any old-timer again. Lack was not a factor in this story. Rather it was drive and overal climate of the story. When it was two Ðhundred degrees left, and no water left, he pushed himself to the light. And also when he saw a building he was determined to get to it."
