"Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced are dirigibles use hydrogen to float. Hydrogen is a highly flammable gas and if it was ignited it was cause a lot of property damage. Also at 1,250 ft there is a lot of wind. The dirigible would blow around the building causing unnatural stress to the building. It would be very difficult to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building."
