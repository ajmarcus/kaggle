"In the essay Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit the cyclist is on a journey to Yosemite National Park and stops for advice on a quicker route. When he asks the old men he says, Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who havent left the confines of their porches since carter was in office. Along with using their advice he faces abandoned ghost towns that they said were thriving spots. The cyclist overcomes the rolling hills of terrain and mirages and the heat of a day in June in the California in deserts. Finally he sees bait and tack shop and when he sees that the men who own the place are older than the other guys he just stares at them in all. Based on the quote you can infer that the cyclist will ignore their advice about having the best map. "
