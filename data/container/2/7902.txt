"The mood created by the author is loving because it talks about how generous and caring his family is. ""... @LOCATION1 graced our kitchen table for meals..."" That quote gives you an idea of how close everybody is ""...family had nothing to do with being a blood relative.""  @CAPS1 around Narciso treats him like family. He learned what family really ment by living in this house during his childhood. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" In the memoir you can see how Narciso loves his family and friends. Overall the main mood of this memoir is loving."
