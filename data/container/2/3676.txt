"In 'Rough @CAPS1 Ahead' the features of the setting and the cyclists surroundings greatly influence him. Because he is in the high deserts of California in June, the climate is hot, dry, and miserable. Another feature of the setting that affects the cyclist, is that he is out in the middle of nowhere. There are no other human beings, cars or buildings for miles. Also, the terrain affects the biker. When the road starts to get bumpy and uneven, it causes him to exhaust his water supply even faster. Overall, the cyclist in this story is greatly affected by his surroundings."
