"The features of the setting affects the cyclist in the story. In the story, it says, The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. I could drop from a heatstroke. This statement clearly says that where the cyclist was riding, water was very hard to find and scare. He is talking about how he will die if he doesnt get water. Another example is that there are no buildings around and is deserted with no one around and many hills and roads. In the story it says, the terrain changing flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. This means that he was partially all by himself and he had no one to go to."
