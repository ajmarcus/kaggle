"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very cool and funky. I say this not to make fun of anyone but to thank them. The author says that his parents unwittingly passed on their skills and love for cooking. This piece of evidence is located in paragraph two. The mood is described as joyous, giddy, excited, and elated. This is because the author is starting to figure out what it's like to have a ""family that isn't related by blood but by race and culture. This evidence is located in paragraph @NUM1. The authors parents invited refugees to stay with them until the got back on their feet. His/@CAPS1 parents did this so whenever they needed anything than they would be alright. This final piece of evidence is located in paragraph seven. These are pieces of evidence that describe the mood of the memoir. (And also of where they are located)."
