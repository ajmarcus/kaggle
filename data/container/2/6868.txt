"In the story Winter Hibiscus written by @CAPS1 Ho. The narrarator goes to a greenhouse that has many flowers but one in perticular catches her eye. A ''winter'' Hibiscus plant. This plant reminds her of her homeland and everything that used to take place there this plant also reminds her of  her grandmother's long silkly gray hair and how she used to watch her dry it in the sun and then she would help her knot it up into a ton with a bud of this plant in it. The author ends the story with this because it counters her statement when she say ""I-I failed the test."" and the end of this passage  says  ""..., then I will take the test again""."
