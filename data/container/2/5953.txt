"Many authors end their storys in different ways. But Minfong Ho ended hers with almost a saying One reason she ended her story this way was she kinda revealed what would happen to Saeng in the future. Like in the end it says I will take that test again. This lets the reader know that she, the author, might write another story about Saeng but it is when she takes the test again. A second example is showing that Saeng is strong and beautiful but will try again. This is show when the author said when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding. see she said this hibiscus which is referring to Saeng. Without some of these writings techniques and hints we might not know if there will be a sequal and what might happen."
