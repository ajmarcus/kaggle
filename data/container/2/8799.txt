"The mood created by the author overall is gratefulness. As Narciso writes about some events in his life you notice he mostly talks about his family. He says that you don't have to be a blood relative to be family, what matters is love.Narciso is mostly grateful to his parents who sacraficed their old lives in Cuba for him to have a better life in the US. Their jobs in Cuba were great but when they got to @LOCATION1 they had to have whatever job they could get.Not only did Narciso's family teach him how to love he learned the real definition of family. It saw what courage it took for his parents to turn the simple house they once had into a home for him."
