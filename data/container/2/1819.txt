"The builders of the Empire State building seem blind of all the dangers that would be a result of the mooring mast. One huge factor in danger was the violent winds at that elevation. The blimp would be swung around on the tether going to the building, which could either damage the building itself, or damage the blimp. Alsoif  the blimp was moving, how would passangers get on and off? They could fall off the loading dock whether they were going on or off the blimp. Passengers could even get blown off the open floor of the Empire State building. Another factor was the high population of New York City, if something like debris had fallen down to the streets, it could probably kill a few walking pedestrians. I would think that the architects would have considered all these factors before trying to begin the project."
