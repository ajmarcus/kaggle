"The mood created by the author is a heartwarming mood. This is so because he talks about his parents with a passion of love and respect. To me that is a heartwarming mood. The author talks about his parents generousity, selflessness, and caring ways. In the memoir it says that the parents let friends and family stay with them until they got back on their feet. The author also talks about how the parents left their family, friends, and careers behind just so that the author, their son, could have a better life. If that is not a heartwarming mood I don't know what is."
