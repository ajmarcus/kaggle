He also talks about all the people that live near him and how he loves them all like family. His parents are very good cooks, and they taught Narciso their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with him today. His mood is very loving and caring, and its his family and how he adores them that is the mood created by the author in the memoir."
