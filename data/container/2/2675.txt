"The obstacles that builders faced while building the Empire State Building was, first the buildings structure was not strong enough, the winds were too strong, and the law. The buildings structure could not hold a @NUM1 foot dirigible. The winds would make the dirigible move, which could also ruin the frame of the building. Also the law said that the airships could not fly too low over a city. That was some of the obstacles that the workers faced while building the Empire State Building."
