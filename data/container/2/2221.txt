"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were two practical obstacles. Nature itself. Even if the dirigible was tethered up to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Another thing was that it was illegal for airships to fly over too low over urban areas. Although two dirigibles attempted but failed, by the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared."
