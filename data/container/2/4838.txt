"The temperature of the place that the cyclist was riding through affected him very much. The temperature caused the cyclist to sweat. This affected him because he would get thirsty and eventually he ran out of water. For example in the text he says the water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips and then it goes on to say, I could drop from from a heat stroke. This showed how it affected him because he thought he is going to drop from the heat."
