"In the storie ""Narciso Rodriguez"" I think the author was very greatful & happy at the moment. I think he was happy, because he was lathing about how Narciso was always in a good mood and how she always loved how to cook in the kitchen with everyone. Also how she still loved her ritual song she sings with her family."
