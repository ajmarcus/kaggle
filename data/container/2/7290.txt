"The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is happy. I think there is hapiness because of what it says on paragraph @NUM1. ""In our neighborhood, despite the customs elsewhere, all of these culture came together in a great solidarity and friendship."" @CAPS2 that mean that there were a happy and friendly family. In conclusion, that's the mood I think the @CAPS1 created and some reasons why."
