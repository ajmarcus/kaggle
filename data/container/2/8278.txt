"The mood created by the author was grateful and happy. The mood was grateful because Narciso was glad his parents moved to the @LOCATION1 and started their wonderful home. Narciso was grateful of this because he grew up in an environment he loved.                                                                                                                                                     The mood created by the author is happy. The mood is happy because Narciso is happy that he grew up around people who loved him. This made him happy because he knew that he was safe and loved with these people. When his community of differences came together to form one community, this made Narciso happy. The mood is both grateful and happy. I would also be grateful for this, happiness is key to having friendships and famalies."
