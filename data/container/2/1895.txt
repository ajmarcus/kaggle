"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced were wheather. Nature itself would ruin the time frame of building. Winds would shift, even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.Another challenge the builders ran into was that dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."
