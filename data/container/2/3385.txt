"The builders of the Empire state Building faced obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The greatest obsticle was safety for pedestrians and the building itself. Most of the dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable. They didnt want the dirigible to explode and fall over pedestrians and catch the whole building on fire. Safety is the main obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when trying to let dirigibles dock there."
