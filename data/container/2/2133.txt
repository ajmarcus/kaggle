"while attempting to let dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. For one thing, there wasn't a whole lot of landing room in New York City for them which ultimately made things tougher. Also, they were forced to put more work into the building by strengthening and modifying the steel frame of it to accommodate the new situation. A lot of money was spent on these new renevations, over sixty thousand dollars. This was done mainly to reduce stress on the building's frame. But overall they managed to get it all done, and make their way through these tricky obstacles."
