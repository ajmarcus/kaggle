"In this paragraph I will be explaining some features of the setting that affected the cyclist. One affect was the uneven, bumpy roads he was trying  to cycle on. If it was flat he wouldn’t have to really be more aware, cause with bumpy roads he has to look out for rocks, holes in the road. Another affect are the hills. He had to put out more energy than if the hills were just flat. Those are some reasons that explain the features of the setting that affect the cyclist."
