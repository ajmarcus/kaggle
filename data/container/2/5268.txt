"The features in the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. One way is he is round stuck with only a little bit of water. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.(Kurmaskie). Also the cyclist was lost because of the old men directions that got him know where because there directions were out of date. Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who havent left the confine of their porches since carter was in office, (Kurmaskie @NUM1). He was giving bad directions and wasnt to pleased. Therefore the cyclist went through some though times."
