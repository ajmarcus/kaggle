"In “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed posted speed limit,” the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way it affected him is the towns were old and deserted. In the story he said “This place might have been a thriving little spot… but @CAPS1 it was a ghost town.” He could not get any water or any directions. The features of the setting affected the cyclist because the roads were bumby and there were many hills. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” @CAPS1 the cyclist had to use all his power to manuever over the hills. The third reason why the setting affected the cyclist was the weather and that it was a desert. “I was traveling through the deserts of California in June.” He was hot, sweaty and thirsty. He was also tired and desperate to find water and town that was not deserted. The features of the setting affected the cyclist in “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit,” by the roads, deserted towns and the lack of water."
