The terrain affected the cyclist by having he/she ride through rough paths inorder to reach their destination.For example, if you walk on sharp rocks, you are based to reach some rough spots where it seems you cant walk. But that is where selfdetermination kicks in. The power to keep yourself moving even though there @MONTH1 be obstacles in your way; you know there will be a better path or a reward at the end another example of a feature is a lack of provision on your trip, when you dont have the right provision to keep you self energised you can t get over your obstacles or even push yourself to do anything.This is why the features of the setting affect the cyclist."
