"the builders of the Empire State Building faced various obstacles and challenges in allowing dirigibles to dock there, including how to attach the mast and how to move people between the dirigible and the building. In order to attach the mast where the dirigibles would land, the builders could not simply fasten it with the cable teather to the top of the building. This would ""add stress to the building's frame"" with the combined pressure of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure. Therefore, the builders had to get the pressure down into the ground by strengthening and altering the building's steel frame.Another obstacle the builder's faced was the challenge of transporting people and luggage from the building to a dirigible floating in the air. The dirigibles would only be tethered by their front ends, but gondola, where the passengers rode, was located underneath the dirigible. this meant the construction of ""a gangplank to an open observation platform"" from which the people and luggage had to be moved @NUM1 floor by a special elevator. Although the builders of the Empire State Building faced various obstacles in building the mast, the one they really should have considered was the dager and impracticalness of docking dirigibles @NUM2 stories over New York City."
