"I think the mood created by the author was very warm, greatful and happy. I think this because he often expresses how his parents sacrificed a lot of things and made his childhood ful of joyous memories. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" In many paragraphs he explains how he admires them for their strength and perseverance in moving from Cuba to @LOCATION1. I also said happy because he is happy that his childhood was so memorable. ""Innocence of childhood... endless celebrations."" This shows me that he enjoyed the parties and being a kid. (growing up in that household.) This is why I think the mood is so grateful and happy."
