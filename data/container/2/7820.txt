"I think the authors mood is, honored, proud, loving, and appreciated. I think the author mood is part of being honored because (in paragraph @NUM1) he really expressed how he feels about his parents being so loving and makes others feel loved and welcomed. I also think he was proud because, he explains (in paragraph @NUM2) how much he appreciates his family and his parents to have open arms and help thoughs in need, and to have such great parents that he does'nt even have words really to express to commitment and kindness his parents have with everyone. Through out the story the author alway's mentions How loving his partent are and you can see in the passage that he picked that trait up with the words and expression he used in the story to express the fact of his parents being loving to their family and their @CAPS1. Those are what I think are his moods and the reason for them."
