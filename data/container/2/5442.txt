"The author concludes the story with the paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow…” to show that Saeng got stronger. She got, stronger because she adjusted to her new home and new environment. Saeng is more confident in herself to take the test again. She doesn’t want to cry again, like she did in her last test. Being more confident and more adjusted is the reason why she has become stronger, and the reason why she wants to take the test again is because she is stronger."
