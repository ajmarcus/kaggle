"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when Saeng was saying this to herself, she made a promise to not give up getting her license and the hibiscus makes her feel like she is at home again. In the text when the mother says, ""@CAPS1 seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers arent as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. Thats what matters.Ó when she says this it makes Saeng not sad because she knows that the hibiscus will remind her of the hibiscus at home and that gives her the power to want to try again in the spring."
