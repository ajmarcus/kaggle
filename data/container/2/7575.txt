"In this memoir, the mood is very pleasant and makes you think of childhood memories. The reason is because he talks about how his parents guided him to be a strong-willed man, and he couldn't have done it unless he had the conditions he did then. He seems to think that if he didnt have the parents and oppurtunities he did then, his life would have been much different. So, the mood in this poem makes you feel like home is where the heart is."
