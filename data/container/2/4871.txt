"There is many things that could have made his bycicle ride much more enjoyable, one thing is if he wasnt in the middle of no where and if he actually knew where he was. For example, There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. There, he had almost no water to get him through the day. For instance, The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. @CAPS1, he did not know where he was going so it was harder for him. In conclusion these are some things that made his trip hard."
