"The mood that the author was portraying in the memoir was a very loving, caring and emotional mood. In paragraph @NUM1 she states ""It was here were I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."""
