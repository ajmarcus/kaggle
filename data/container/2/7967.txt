"The memoir looks back on his childhood, with fondness, so I'd call the mood whistful. Yes, the author creates a whistful mood, by talking about his childhood home, friends and family. But... whistfulness only lasts until the end of paragraph @NUM1... after that it becomes a greatful mood, where he's giving out thanks and describing what his parents went through. If it is possible to have two moods, then this memoir does. The moods are both whistful and greatful. Yes."
