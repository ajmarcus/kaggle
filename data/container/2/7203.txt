"The mood that the author sets is thankfullness. He is thankful for all the things, scarifices his parents had to for him. For example ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give thier children a better life, even thought it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This is why the author wrote this memoir to thank his parents for what they did for him."
