"There are many ways to describe the mood of the author in this memoir. I think the overall feeling and mood in the memoir is happiness and greatfulness. Narciso Rodriguez's parent were from Cuba and they werent very wealthy. Narciso grew up in a three room apart ment in a niehgborhood filled with immigrants from Cuba, @LOCATION1, and @LOCATION2. Narciso had great parents according to the memoir it says in paragraph seven, last sentence ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 means that @CAPS1 didn't care about the amount of space they had in the apartment @CAPS1 just cared and love the amount of love and the relationship they all had eachother."
