"The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist by describing that he is in a desert-like area in Lodi, California. They say it is very hot and there is sand everywhere. There also aren’t many places to cool off at. They also described the water and Lodi to be about @NUM1 degree in temperature. The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite to get away from the heat and to have a cool, shady pine trees to sit under, and cool fresh water. This affects the cyclist because he gets dehydrated because of the horrid heat."
