"Based on the excerpt of the ""@PERSON1"" by the blueprints of our Lives, That mood created by the author is happness and @CAPS1.When the author restate when the girl says I will allways be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. That shows How much @CAPS2 cares about her mother and father and How respectful @CAPS2 is towards them. Anothe example that her mother and father is @CAPS3 and cares a lot is when her mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. That line proves how much the mom and dad care about there daughter."
