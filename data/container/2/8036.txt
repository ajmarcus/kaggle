"In the memoir, the author creates a sort of grateful, appreciative mood. Throughout the memoir, Narciso repeats how grateful he is to have such courageous parents. For example in the first few sentences of paragraph @NUM1, ""My mother and father come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind thier families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.""  this shows how grateful he is for his parents, to do all this, just to give him a better life. I would feel just as grateful For my parents if they had done this for myself, just as how Narciso felt."
