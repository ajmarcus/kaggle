"The dusty, dry setting has a serious effect on the cycling author. It got so long and hot that, @CAPS1 blues tune summer time rattled around inmy deteriorating brain. The author has spent so long cycling through heat, his brains starting to shut down. Its also because there is very little water left for him. Another problem is that every building/town except the last building is deserted. So without any chance of being refueled and restocked, its the author v.s nature. Plus, as the author states, the directions came from old people who, havent left their porches since Carter was in office. The word has greatly changed. Towns have become deserted, buildings rundown but the roads are kept in shape. The towns the old people mentions are now ghost towns, and are no help to the author. "
