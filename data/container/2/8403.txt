"The mood of the memoir I believe to be grateful or enspioring. Narciso's parents are imigrants from Cuba who live in a rasict community and are working to be able to support there kids. They are great parents to Narciso and provide him with basic nacessidies. They feed him, and buy him clothes. Narciso is very kind and thankful for the trouble his mother and father go through and he is also very considerate to try to help them when they need it. The mood is grateful because that is how Narciso feels toworrds his parents."
