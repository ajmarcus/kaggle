"The Empire State Building faced obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles, ""enormous steel framed balloons"" commonly called blimps, dock there. One of the main issues was the pressure on the building caused by the dirigibles. As said in the excerpt The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, by @ORGANIZATION2, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" (paragraph @NUM1). Over @MONEY1 worth of modifications were made to strengthen and accommodate for this new situation of dirigibles."
