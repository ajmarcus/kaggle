"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted the were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle the builders faced was finding a way to have a dirigible moored on top of the Empire State building without adding stress to the buildings frame. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (Lsted). Another obstacle that was face was money. they needed to make more than sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" (Lsted). The biggist obstacle the builders had to face was nature, the winds would shift the dirigible to much. ""The greatest obstacle to the success of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (Lsted). As you can see there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
