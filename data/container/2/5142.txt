"The setting in this short story cause the cyclist to doubt his survival. The main problem is water, or lack there of. The cyclist has no water and thinks it’s only a matter of time before he dies. Another big problem is the rough terrain. The rough terrain is hard for the cyclist to overcome. Also, there is no buildings, people, or cars in sight to save him. Until he finds the bait shop, if anything would have happened to him, there would’ve been no one there to help."
