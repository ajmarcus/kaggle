"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is a clothing designer who grew up in @LOCATION1 with all different immagrets. The mood of it is that home isn't a physical space but relationships. ""Growing up in this enviornment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" (@NUM1). He had a: ""Close-Knit community of honest, hard working immigrants.."" (@NUM1). I think Narciso would be a clothing designer if he didnt grow up with these people."
