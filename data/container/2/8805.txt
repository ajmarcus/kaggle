"The mood created by the author is a grateful mood. It's grateful because the boy kept on talking about how thankfull he is for all the stuff he has. Another reason why the mood is grateful is because all of the people in the neighborhood will all come together and eat with eachother, visit with eachother, and help eachother. I know the mood is grateful because it says in paragraph @NUM1 ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."""
