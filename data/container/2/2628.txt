The builders had to face alot. They had to rebuild the whole top again so the dirigibles could dock there. Architects couldent just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State. A Dirigible on top of a building held by a single cable tether would add alot of stress to the buildings frame. The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be upgraded and strengthened. Also all of these modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars to make the buildings framework better.
