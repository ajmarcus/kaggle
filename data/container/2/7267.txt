"The mood created by the author in the memoir is like a mellowish mood. Almost like a fun loving feeling. The author had literally put himself into the memoir as I read. Paragraph two, had used parentheses several times within the text. The parentheses had given the author's look into his reality. Which had helped to create a calm mellow feel. Over all the mood was fairley simple, fun. In the last sentence it stated that the author had said ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" It had basically described that the family did not have much, but made the best of what they did have. The last sentence had made the whole memoir have a calm mellowish feel. In conclusion, the author in the memoir had created a mellow feeling throughout the whole memoir."
