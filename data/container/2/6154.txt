"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that the hibiscus is a symbol for Saeng. In the sping time the hibiscus grows just like Saeng. When Saeng got to the new place she was small and peuney just like the plant. ÒIts leaves quavering in the wind"" (@NUM1). This quote tells us the the plant was weak a peuney. If the plant was strong it would not be quivering. The fact that Saeng brokedown and bought the plant tells us she was not strong. And at the end the author uses that paragraph to tell the reader that the hibiscus is strong and so is Saeng and the can over come anything."
