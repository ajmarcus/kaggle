"The author creates a happy and grateful mood in the memoir. Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. In our neigborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celabrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was where I learned the real definition of family. I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"
