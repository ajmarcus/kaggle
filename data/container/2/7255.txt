""my parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956."" The mood being created is detirmenation. The parents were determined to make it to the United States because that was hard to do. But the parents did make it to the United States. The other piece of evidence found is ""in 1961, I was born into the simple house, situated in a two-family, blonde-brick building in the @CAPS1 bound section of Newark, New Jersey."" The mood being created is happiness and sadness. There is happiness because he was just born. The sadness is that they couldn't go to the hospital and they live in a two-family house. This is the moods created in the memior."
