"I think the overall mood created by the author, is comfort. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, the author writes, ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" the author tries to set the scene and give the reader a good sense of what growing up in his home was like.Also, the fact that they took relatives in and helped them get their lives back together again is comforting. In paragraph @NUM2, he writes, ""Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" the family knew that their family would do the same for them if they ever needed somewhere to stay.Finally, the amount of love and caring in the house is very strong. Paragraph @NUM3 is all about how much the author cares about his parents and is very grateful to them. the comforting sense of a home is very important to Narciso Rodriguez, the author, and also his very large family."
