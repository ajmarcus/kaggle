The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The temperature in the area affect the way he drinks his water which leads him to thinking he is going to die because he is running out of water. The “towns” he comes to are so deserted he thinks he is going in the wrong direction. All the settings in the story also help him not to give up but keep on going. In conclusion even though he had to go through all that doubt he was going to be alive in the end he still went on and tried. In the end he did make it and all it was worth it.
