"I think the mood the author is trying to give is thankful, and satisfied, and that he is loved. An example of his satisfaction is ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the to life in our home."" And an example of his thankfulness is ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today..."" And lastely an example of him being loved is ""Growing up in this enviorment instilled me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" I can tell that Narciso feels all three of those feelings and he presents it well."
