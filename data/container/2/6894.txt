"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show how Saeng relates the hibiscus overcoming of problems to her own overcoming of problems. Saeng is comparing the hibiscus to herself. If the hibiscus can adapt to its surroundings, then so can she. And if the hibiscus makes it through the winter, then she too can make it; and she will re-take the test that she failed before. Also, before this she says that things that were once strange to her now seemed familiar, like the geese. She then see’s them overhead flying in a V. They are also adapting to their surroundings by flying to a warmer place, and Saeng too can adapt."
