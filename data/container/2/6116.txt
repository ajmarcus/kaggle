"The author concludes the story with the paragraph -“ when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” (@NUM1) because she feels that when the hibiscus blooms she can too bloom by passing the test. Also Saeng is relating herself to the hibiscus. “Its’ flower arn’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it throu in here, this winter hibiscus.” (@NUM1) Her mother is trying to tell her she can be strong also. She too can make it through the cold months. “like the geese she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etered against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance.” (@NUM1) Just like the geese Saeng is realizing to be proud of herself and there will be other chances. Don’t always doubt yourself becase they will be other chances. Don’t be afraid to try again."
