"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness because in mostly all of the paragraphs he talks about how much he loves his parents and his cuban culture. Narciso talks about how his parents made his everyday house into a home. That is why I think Narciso is happy in this memior. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""Within the walls, my young parents created our traditional cuban home, the very heart of which was my kitchen."""
