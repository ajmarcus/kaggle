"The mood to me was love and to getherness. Every one in the community would help each other one out. In the passage they said ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not neciraraly not there own kind, were clearly in need."" That tells me they will help and love anyone and any race like they were part of there own family. That is the mood this story portraise to me."
