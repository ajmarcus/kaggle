"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by @CAPS1 Ho a girl named Saeng failed her drivers test that day then vowed that she would retake from the spring. She ends with this statement to say that it is a new season and a new beginning for her into her new life. This archetype being the changing from harsh cold winter to nice warm spring time shows that the trouble her mother and Saeng would get better. As hard trouble winter left than their is calmwarm new beginning spring. Saeng knows this and knows that she is going to pass."
