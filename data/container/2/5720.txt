In the story I think the author concludes  that  paragraph  with  the  story  because  Saeng  is  saying  that  when  she  comes  back  or when  she next  sees  the  hibiscus  bloom  again  she  will  then  take  the  test  but  until then  she  feels  out  of  place  and  she  is no use to the  arrangements  she is living in  now  and  she  feels  uncomforatable  but  until  then  she  thinks  that she will not  be able  to do  will  until  she  is in  her  bloms  tow  a  where  it  is  horman   for  her.
