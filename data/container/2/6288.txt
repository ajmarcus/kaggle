The author concludes the story with this paragraph I think because since the girl failed her test the bud reminds her of her grandmothers long grey hair and I guess that gives her good luck so when the winter passes by and the spring time hits thats buds start to come back out and thats when she will take her test again. Thats why the author made this statement the last sentence of the story.
