"The mood the author created in the memoir was happy and joyful. The author explains were he lived as a child very vividly. from the air mixed with the aromas of cuban food to to cuban music the author still loves today. It seems like he had a good childhood. He says his parent were selfless and took in refugees in their home. It gives this story a warm feel like it could almost be your mom or dad. He make the story very personal with all the family members he explains. His parent, did the very best they could for their family. That is how the mood is set."
