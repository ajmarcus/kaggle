"The mood created in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez is a grateful, cheery tone. As Narciso talks about his parents' Cuban background and tradition, by his tone you can tell how proud and happy he is in his heritage. Also, as in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2, he talks very highly of his parents, how they made their house a home, and how grateful he is to have them as parents. The mood makes me think of the color yellow, and of the sun, happiness and warmth. Narciso Rodriguez did a great job setting this cheery mood in his memoir."
