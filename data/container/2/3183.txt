"First of all the Empire State Building wasn't made for landing dirigibles on top of it. The architects had to redesign the whole top of the building. When they did that they never bothered to put proper landing gear down for the dirigibles. It was a bad day out, weatherwise, then it would be very difficult to land a dirigible without the proper landing gear. The dirigible is over @NUM1 feet long, without a very large landing service, it would be dangerous for the people in the dirigible, the people on the ground, and the people helping land the dirigible."
