"Setting that affected the cyclist was water tempeter, rolling hills and condition of the roads. Water was a factor because he need cool water to keep him hydrated he came to a shed with pumps after running out of water. He started pumping the water it was hot but he took it he tried to let it cool down but it didnt. Rolling hills was another a tender to the cyclist hardships because the road started off flat then ended up in hills going up his can strain the leg and makes it harder to keep riding. Another hardship was road condition, it was smooth at frist then it became rough and rocky. Those was some affects the cyclist had to over come"
