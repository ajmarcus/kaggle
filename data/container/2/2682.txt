"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. First they had to make sure that the mast wasn't too heavy to put on top of the building and when they realized it was they made @MONEY1 of modifications to the building so that it could support the mast. They also had to make sure it would be safe, transporting people through this dirigible. It depended on the wind and climate. They also had to make the building taller than the Chrysler building. They wanted to transform New @CAPS1 transportation. In the end, they realized that docking on the building was not possible if they wanted to keep everything safe to the public."
