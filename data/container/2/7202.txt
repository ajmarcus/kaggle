"The mood that's created by the author in the memoir is happiness but at the same time sadiness or to give up. Happiness is one mood because the author describes how his family has lived in @LOCATION2 (New Jersey) and how his family was not the only one to immagrate from their country. Their neighborhood is made up of Spanish, Cuban and Italian immagrants. The author has also made a few friends his first one being Alegria or the landlord's daughter. But the author did show some sadiness when he and his family had left Cuba. They had left friends, family, jobs and their country that they had loved. The author still listens to Cuban music when he does cook."
