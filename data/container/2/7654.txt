"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy, delightful, unique. I believe the author is happy because he/she is very grateful for the love of cooking his/her parents passed down to him/her. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" I believe he's/she is delightful just the way he/she wrote the memoir. The words she/he used, the way he/she wrote them just sounds delightful to be who he/she is. The author sounds unique to me because he/she is just happy that he/she is Cuban and is happy with what he/she has. This is what I think the authors mood is in the memoir."
