The author ends the story with that paragraph because it shows how Saeng feels connected to the plant that reminds her of home. This connection is important because it shows how people can find ways to deal with changes in their lifes. Saeng does this by buying and planting the hibiscus plant so that she can see it and be reminded of home. She also buys the plant so that it motivates her to take the test she failed again in the spring when the flower is budding.
