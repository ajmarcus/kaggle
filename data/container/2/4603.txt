"To a cyclist, the surrounding setting can either cause triumph or despair. The cyclist was given very old directions. He was given back roads that are abandoned now. These towns had no people in them normally that would not matter, but he “was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” (@NUM1). If there was shade, a breeze, and @NUM2 weather, he would be fine, but he is pedaling a bike in a desert during the summer. A “ghost town” with no good water could have killed him. A cyclist needs to know their surroundings and be prepared for what nature throws at them."
