"I believe the author adds this passage to the Story to represent determination and @LOCATION1. While Saeng is not originally from @LOCATION2 she is determined and willing to try and. adapt to our @CAPS1. While the winter was cold and harsh in many ways for her, the Spring will Bring foregiveness and relief from her @CAPS2. She will try to pass the driving test again to further herself into american @CAPS1, while the blooming of the Hibiscus will bring her @CAPS4 to home."
