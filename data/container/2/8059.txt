In the memoir narciso rodriguez by The blueprints of our Lives The mood the author created in the memoir was grateful the author created that mood because he was and is still grateful abought how his parents left behind their family and friends and Jobs so that he can have a better life also the mood is grateful because they passed on their rich culinary skills to him. Also he is grateful for livving in a simple house with all those wonderful neighbors and freinds. I think the mood created by the author is grateful because this is a memoir of all the good things in his life and all of the stuff he should be gratefull for having.
