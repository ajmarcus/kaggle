"some of the obstacles the builders went throw was that they had to make many changes, such as they could not just drop a mast on top of the Buildings flat roof. The blimp would give the building stress held by a single cable. the blimps load and pressure from the wind would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation. The @CAPS1 could have to be strengthened to accommodate this new situation. over sixty thousands of dollars for the new frame work."
