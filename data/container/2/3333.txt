"The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building flat roof. When they tryed to build it there was not enough space so they tried to force it but that @CAPS1 mess everything up. ""A thousand-foot dirgible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, without strees to the building's frame."" At times when they try to add things that made the building only heavyer and more likely to fall. They try to add more things to only make it look better but what they didn't know is that it was only gain to fall more."
