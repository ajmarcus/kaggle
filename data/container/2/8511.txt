"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the author describes how his first home as a child was a warm and inviting place to live. As described in paragraph ""... my prents always kept their arms and door open"", meaning his home was a loving place where anyone in need was welcome to stay. The overall mood of this memoir is that the community the author grew up in was a unified and happy one, where all the other immigrants were ""family""."
