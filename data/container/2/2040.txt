"Based on the excerpt there are a few key obstacles the builders face, one being the safety of the people in the dirigibles and people below them, and two being nature itself.The safety of the people was critical because if something was not safe then it would not be put to use. There were many things that could go wrong such as, the blimp hitting a spire and killing all the people below.The Greatest obstacle was nature. If the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast it would get wraped around the building, or just getting to the mooring would be difficult because of the wind.Overall the mooring mast was not a practical Idea. It was just something thought up to compete with the @CAPS1 building, and was not thought through with the aspects of safety in mind."
