"The mood created by the author in the memoir was decribed passionately and emotionally. The mood in this whole memoir was gratefullness. starting from the beginning how his family passed on their traditions. Also having people around him family and friends who helped him, living close in reach. With his parents giving up everything from their past just to start a family with a better life. sacrificing all they had in life. His life was filled with joy and happiness, thanks to his family and friends."
