"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy setting. In the memoir, the setting is a happy setting, in a sense of living because in the passage, there are parenthesis that explain how much the narrator appreciAtes his family and his heratige. In the passage in paragraph @NUM1, it explains how the families are close and help those in need, even wheN things arent going so soomthly for them. Also there are certain words in the passage that would help with the mood, words such as selflessly, solidary, love, friendship, and sacrifice. In my opinion, this words help bring the mood to a happy, calming feeling to the passage. The ""happy"" mood is created by the authoR in this memoiR."
