"The worker faced many obsticals while building the Empire State Building. Sence Al Smith was trying to compete with the Chrysler Building for the tallest building he kept adding on to the Empire State Building. To make his building the tallest in the world he added the mooring mast. This mast would make the Empire State building 1,250 feet tall. The builders had to redesine the entier buildings sceleton. They had to make sure the Empire State Building could hold up the mast. The mast was made so that Dirigibles could land thire and people could get on and off it. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" The builders fixed the steel fram of the building with in two months. The building went on as planned. After awhile the people begin to see that the mas couldn't be used for dirigibles because of the violent wind currents at the top of the building."
