"the mood created in the memoir, I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. Ive often told them that what they Did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. Ive often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance and I've thanked them repeatedly But in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how importand family and friends are."
