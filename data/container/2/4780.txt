"The features in the story tell me that it was in a very dry, not populated area. It says that there were rolling hills, in a desert of California, and that it was dry. I think those things affected the cyclist by dehydrating him. Going up and down hills can be very tiring, especially when you dont have a lot of water left, and need to save some. The quote I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June, tells me a lot about the story. In a desert in California in June during the summer is a very brave and stupid thing to do. It s twice as hot during the summer."
