"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a couple of obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles the builders had was with the stress of the dirigibles load as said in the excerpt in paragraph @NUM1.             Another obstacle they had with landing the dirigibles to dock was that they had to modify and strengthened the steel frame of the Empire State Building. They needed to do that so it can accommodate this new situation, which is to get dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building."
