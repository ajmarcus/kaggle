She sates, “The familiar fragrance filled her lungs and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long grey hair.” The flower reminds her of her grandmother. The mother says, “??? Seen this kind blooming along the lake, it’s flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make through the cold months.” She’s trying to make her daughter feel better.

She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now.”"
