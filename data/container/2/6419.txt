"The reason that the author had ended the story the way she did was to leave the reader on the last thought. Also it symbolizes rebirth. When Saeng says, “... this hibiscus is budding ...” (Ho @NUM1). She is also describing that they will start over when spring comes. And that leaves the reader with the last thought about Saeng, and how she has overcome living in the new place. Lastly, it ties up @CAPS1 feelings and experiences the whole time she had moved, “... I will take the test again” (Ho @NUM1), which tells the reader she will continue to give her new home a shot. In conclusion, the reason for this quote being the last paragraph is to show that Saeng will continue to try to overcome ??? (WORDS NOT @CAPS2) "
