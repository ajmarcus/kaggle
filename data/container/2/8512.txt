"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very positive. I believe that the mood is positive because in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Also ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly"" @CAPS1 the whole memoir there is a lot of positiveness. That is the mood from the memoir."
