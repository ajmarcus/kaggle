"The builders faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One of the biggest and hard obstacle to over come is saftey for everyone. The builders had to worry about the safty of the people coming in and out of the dirigible, the people on the near by streets and to the people in the side of the building. Saftey was one of the main reasons why the dock never was completed.Another huge obstacle that faced the builders was nature. This is true because winds at the top of the tall buildings were always changing and this would make it hard to land the dirigible on it. Like the excerpt states in paragraph @NUM1, Dirigibles were weighted down in the back by lead weights and this would cause a problem with pedestrians walking under in the streets."
