"In the essay Rough Road Ahead ;Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie he goes through all kinds of settings where the going could get better or worse. I noticed the terrain changing, flat roads was replaced with short rolling @NUM1 Kurmaskie). This shows or explains that the going could get a little tougher now because he will have to be riding up hills and he is almost out of water. There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind (@NUM2 Kurmaskie). This explains that the man could not get water or a ride from anywhere around, because there was nothing out there to at. This is how the setting features affected the cyclists."
