"The mood is well many different things. But mainly the mood is loving. I think it's mainly loving because in the memoir at both the begining and end, Narciso talks about how nice, sweet, and caring his parents are. For example in paragraph @NUM1 he says ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" And in that sentence you can see that both Narciso's mother and father would always welcome people into their house."
