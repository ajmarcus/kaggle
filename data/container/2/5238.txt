"In the story “rough road ahead” the setting and the features affect the cyclist. For example in the story he says “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you had left to circulate”. This shows that the features are rough because he would most likely not be that desperatly thirsty unless it was very hot out. The setting and features of this story is it takes place in California, on a hot day. Another quote that could support the question is when the author says, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage.” This shows that it is hot because he is sweating. This also could show that it is hot because he thinks it’s a mirage, and people usually see them in the desert, where it is hot."
