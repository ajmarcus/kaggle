"In the article ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by The Blueprints of our lives the mood of the author in the memoir was he was thankful for everything he got so like the mood was quite and loving I picked quite because he has grew up nothing really exciting happened in his life he grew up in @LOCATION1 and his parents were from @CAPS1 parents were very nice people and alway wanted to give their kid a better life and he's alway been grateful for his parents they were the originally parents that made his life not that much excitiing and also picked loved as a mood because in the article ""always filled the air with not just scent in misic but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of family meaning his mood was he felt loved by his family. Thats why chose quite and loving."
