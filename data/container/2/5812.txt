"In the story, “Winter Hibiscus,” by Minfong Ho, the author’s final paragraph shows how much the hibiscus means to her. The author uses symbolism when, he talks about the hibiscus because it is a strong plant just like the girl needs to be to pass the driving test. The author put the paragraph at the end to show that if the hibiscus can come back, after winter, so can the girl. In conclusion, the author used the last paragraph to emphasize the meaning of the hibiscus."
