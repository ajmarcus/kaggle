Setting  depends on how you can go or move. The town hills helped the cyclist. The up hills didn’t. The cyclist  got a bad idea or aditude when he saw the towns he was upset and mad he didn’t want to die and yet he though. He was going two. He said he wouldn’t trust old men anymore. They didn’t know where were talking about .How and why did he trust even in the first place.
