Setting  depends on how you can go or move. The town hills helped the cyclist. The up hills didnt. The cyclist  got a bad idea or aditude when he saw the towns he was upset and mad he didnt want to die and yet he though. He was going two. He said he wouldnt trust old men anymore. They didnt know where were talking about .How and why did he trust even in the first place.
