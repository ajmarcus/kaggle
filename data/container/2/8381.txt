"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives, shows an specific mood. The mood from this is happieness and satisfaction. The family is happy because they got a new home, they have a child, and they made pretty good friends from the nabiorhood. The satisfaction part is in there too when they are satisfiyed with what they got like, a job, a home, family, friends, and they are makeing money. After all moods depend on your surroundings, like the people not the merchendise. And thats all that matters."
