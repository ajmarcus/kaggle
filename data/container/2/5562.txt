"The author shows a willingness to try harder in this story. She states that, In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. I think the author realizes that she is going to have to adapt. Also, saying that she will wait till the spring, means she is going to try again, and not give up. The author has a sentimental value to. Insince she is waiting for the hibiscus to bud, I believe she is referring that hibiscus to her country. Insince she has left her country, the hibiscus is the closet thing she has to it, and therefore, she will wait with the flower"
