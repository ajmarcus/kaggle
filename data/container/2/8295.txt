"Narciso creats a mood that shows family ties and unity within his community. By showing the way that each member of the community are willing to help each other gives a positive and freindly mood to the memoir. Also, he shows how members of the community treat each other as family regardless of race or ethnicity. This gives the the memoir a loving and accepting mood to it."
