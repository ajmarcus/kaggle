"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" the girl Saeng @CAPS1 the drivers test ""I-I failed the test"" said Saeng. She had bought a hibiscus because the flower remined her of some of the memories from home and the hibiscus she had at herhouse. at the end she says that she will retake the test when the geese come back, the snow has melted and the hibiscus is budding. She does this I think because she needs time to just think things through to just remember back home and to make a hibiscus garden. The hibiscus in this story is just like Saeng. They both did something wrong or @CAPS1 something Saeng failed the test and the hibiscus was constrited to a pot. But they both are going to change the bad thing.."
