"The mood created by the author, in my opinion, is a happy mood. It is happy because the author gives the reader a great explanation and description of his life at home. The author created a happy mood also because it showed that his parents were not selfish and that they wanted their children to have a better life in the United States. They had left their whole family behind. Also, Narciso talks about how he and the rest of the immigrants had to deal with racism. But, they were still happy and determined to be, so they all work together happily and in unity. I think it shows that the author not only had family in a nice house, but in the neighborhood as well. The story gave me a sense of a really good, close-knit family. Including the importance of one."
