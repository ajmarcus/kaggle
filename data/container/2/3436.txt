The builders had to go through many obstacles to @CAPS1 to allow the dirigible to dock on the @ORGANIZATION2. The first thing that was a problem with geting it to the top of the Empire State Building. They said the wind made it really hard to get the dirigible up there with out it poping. There was also the safty of it being up there. There was already a fire from another dirigible catching on fire. The gases inside are really flamable and that would make a really big problem. The last thing that they had to conider was if Airships were to Low. The dirigible would pop. for all those reason they had to concider them to @CAPS1 to allow the dirigible on the Empire State Building.
