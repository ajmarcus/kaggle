One way he creats a sad mood in the article is in paragraph @NUM1, he talks about how imigrants leave their families, friends and carrer, just to come to @LOCATION1 to do good and to lead your children in a good place. In paragraph @NUM2, he also says he will always be greatful to his @CAPS1. Leaving your freinds and families behind is a brave action.He also creates a sad mood when he says that all imigrants come selflessly to this country to give their children a better life. The author is showing that he knows how immigrants come to @LOCATION1. He also creates a sad mood by never talking about the good things."
