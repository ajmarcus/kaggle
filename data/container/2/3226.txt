The builders faced many problems trying to allow the dirigibles to dock. The biggest obstacle the had was the wind. At that elevation the was constantly shifting. If the dirigibles was tethered the back would swivel. Another problem was that they could not weigh it down. Sence it was elevated if the dirigible was weighted down it would fall. Those are some of the obstacle the builder faced.
