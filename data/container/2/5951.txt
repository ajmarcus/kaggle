"In the story, I believe Saeng is sad because she misses her home and the hibiscus flower. She ends the story off well because she can now have a since of peace with herself by waiting to take the test again. I believe thats why she ended the story like she did so she doesnt leave herself worried or angry. She can turn a negative attitude into a positive one when she says she will retake the test when the geese return and hibiscus is budding."
