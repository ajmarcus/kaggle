In this story it is about how Saeng and the hibiscus plant are similar when it comes to adapting to their surrounding and how her and the plant will keep continuing just like Saeng with her “test”. But I know this because its says “Then I will take that test again” her saying that is her saying she will thrive again just like the hibiscus plant. So in conclusion she really is much like the plant and will continue for many seasons to come and also adapt to the changes just like the hibiscus.
