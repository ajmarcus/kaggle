"The mood created by the author was great. He made it so Narciso was very happy, and proud to of grown up in Cuba. He also made it so Narciso was grateful for everything. For example, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills, and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am externally grateful). The mood created by the author was a great mood."
