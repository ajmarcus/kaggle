"The rider in the story Rough Road Ahead by Joe Kurmaskie has a very analyzing mind, which is affected by things around him. At first, the rider rode into the morning...with a smile because of the bright sun, and the cool pines and rushing rivers...he is very confident with the old mens directions, this first sign of disapointment is when he comes to the ramshackle shed... And the ...sight of this was troubling... to him, but he rode on. He thinks as he rides over the crippling hills that maybe this wasnt such a great idea. Finally he comes to a old bait shop, and the modern bathroom that he enters to drink from, gives him relief from the desert he had just been riding through."
