"The mood the author set was warmth and happiness. He describes how hard it is growing up in a racist time, and how the real meaning of family is changed through different points of view. Also he shows how the parents are selfless and open minded even when things weren't going there way. He brings cultural diversity and unstanding to describe the neighborhoods family like relationship."
