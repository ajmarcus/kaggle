The @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was the @CAPS1 had to fix the frame of the building in order to transmit the stress of the dirigible to the bottom of the building. Another obstacle the @CAPS1 faced was the @CAPS1 had to complete the roof before the framing of the mooring mast could take place. The @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building also had to make sure that the mast's skeleton was made out of steel so that the mast looked like the rest of the empire State building and not stick out.
