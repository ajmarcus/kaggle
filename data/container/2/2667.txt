"When building the Empire State Building, there was obstacles faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state building flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building frame. So the architects have to motify it and stregthen the building. Spending over sixty thousand dollars on the new motification. The building will turn from @NUM1 floors to 102. From there dirigible passenger will board from there. In conclusion when building the Empire State Building there was obstacles faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
