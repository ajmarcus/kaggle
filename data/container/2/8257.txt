"The mood of this memoir is @CAPS1. I say this @CAPS2 his family always let people from the neighbor hood come over and they were like family. His parents let people stay with them ""until they got back on their feet."" @CAPS3 admired his parents for their ""strength and perseverance"". Through everything they had been through."
