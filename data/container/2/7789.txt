"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the memoir gives a loving and thankful tone. The loving and thankful tone is snowing the definition of ""family"". In paragraph seven the author states, ""and for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows that the tone is thankful for what the parents had done and love them at the same time. As I aformentioned, the tone is love and thanked."
