"They ran into a few problems when it @CAPS1 to building this. They realized after that it wasnt that smart or that safe to have a dirigible hanging by a 102 floor building just by one cable tether. Another problem they ran into was the fact that they couldnt control mother nature. If it was a really windy day out it would be hard to keep it steady. And if there wasnt enough support on the building frames, then it could potentially collapse."
