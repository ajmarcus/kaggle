"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the mood is very grateful. All throughout the story, the other kept stating that he is extremely grateful to his parents for their selflessness and care. This mood shows most in paragraph @NUM1 because he continually thanks his parents for moving to the United States from Cuba to help him when he is born. He thanks them for leaving their friends, family and jobs to help him, even if the new jobs they get are not what they deserve.So, as you can see, the author is very grateful to his parents, making this the mood."
