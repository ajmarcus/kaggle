The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir is very touching. the memoir explains how as a kid he didnt have much growing upas a kid but he did have family and he was extreamly greatful and proud of his parents for their efforts to start a new family in a different country without knowing the languge. When I hear about someone being that @CAPS1 it makes me think how times have changed from whe Narciso was growing up in the @NUM1's. He was so greatful and happy when compaired to now he has nothing. But he was abel to show all his gratude with the deepest heart warming simpathyall in all @CAPS2 learned from his parents and knew that family was the most important thing you can have.
