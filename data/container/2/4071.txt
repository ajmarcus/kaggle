"The cyclist in Rough road Ahead was riding his bike in the middle of June, and in California. Both are very bad if you are lost and on a bike. This is because in June it usually hot, and I know in @CAPS1 its usually always hot, The cyclist is on a bike this means he has to pedde everywhere he goes. This is not along going to use up all his energy but also make him hot, And when your this hot you need to keep hydrated. But your lost so if you use all your water before you find safty then your in major trouble. Also In California theres like Hills, and mountains and stoff and peddling up a mountain isnt an easy trick."
