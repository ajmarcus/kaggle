"The author's mood is very grateful and happy. The author's parents were originally from Cuba, and arrived in the United States in 1956. The author moved into a modest, three- room apartment. Both the author's parents had rich culinary skills and a love for cooking. The author inherited his/her skills from his/her parents. They lived in a community of hard-working immigrants from @LOCATION2, Cuba, and @LOCATION3. The author's parents were very nice and friendly. They invited immigrants to their house to eat and celebrate the arrival of the United States. The author learned the real definition of ""family"" in his/her new home and community. The author is grateful to his/her parents for their love and sacrifice."
