"The features of the setting in the essay caused the cyclist to suffer and continue being determined. The author of the essay used phrases such as ‘the sun was beating down” and “high deserts of California in June” to emphasize the extreme heat that caused the cyclist extreme thirst and heat exhaustion. The essay also says “short rolling hills”, “tumbleweeds” and “long, crippling hill” to describe the difficult terrain the cyclist faced that caused him to be tired and slower.  Finally, the cyclist is faced with a “rediculously large snake” and plants and weeds which get in his way and force him to slow down."
