"The mood created in this memoir is love and unity. (@CAPS1 @NUM1) ""... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This means that they were close, loving, and unified. This memoir gave me the feeling that just a house is not a home until there is love. ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"". This also gives me the feeling of warmth and love."
