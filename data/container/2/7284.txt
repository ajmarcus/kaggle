"Narciso Rodriguez loves his family and home very much. In his memoir, he talks about the sacrifices his parents made and how truly grateful he is that his parents moved to New Jersey for a better life for themselves and him, no matter what the cost. His memoir is all about the love for his parents and his gratitude toward them. He really wants people to be able to feel to happiness that he feels when he thinks about his home and his wonderful life that his parents provided for him. He realizes his luck and therefore his memoir is very upbeat and shows that even in hard times, you can live life to its full extent."
