"The mood created by the author in the memoir was happy, enjoyable, and worth living. I say happy because they had family to be with, and other friends to help them if anything. I say enjoyable because the author talks about how they (main character) had the first birthday and first friend. I would enjoy all my birthdays if I was that person and also my first friend. I also said worth living because they had food on their table everyday. And nothing in the memoir said anything about struggling. This is why I explain the mood as happy, enjoyable, and worth living."
