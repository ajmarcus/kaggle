"The author gave a @CAPS1 and cultural mood to the memoir. He talks about the music and food of his childhood but he also talks about his Extended ""family"" and how they always had someone staying in the house until they could get back on their feet. He also talks about how the House dosn't make a home- its the people that do. If no one lived in a House it could never be called a home. The family and friends @CAPS2 bring it closer and closer to being a Home."
