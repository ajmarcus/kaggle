"The mood created by the author is @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and relaxing. I think that because all he's talking about is his family and how much his parents did for him. For example in @CAPS3 @NUM1 it says ""I will never forget how my Parents turned this simple house into a home."" To me that sounds like @CAPS2 because he knows he can always come home to his Parents if he ever need help. Another example is in @CAPS3 @NUM1 it says ""I learned there about how to love"". That to me sounds like when he was growing up it was rough and he never actually loved some one in his life until now."
