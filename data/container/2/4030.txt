"The setting very much affects the cyclist. ÒI maneuvered down the hill.Ó This statement shows him going down the hill. If the hill wasnt there then it would hawe been a whole lot easier for him to get to where he was going, also he would have had more energy. If there werent anyhills to get in his way."
