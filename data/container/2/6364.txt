"The author concludes this story with hope in this sentence. The begining was very negative with Saeng failing her drive’s test and her mother yelling at her. But when this sentence comes the reader is filled with hope for the young girl Saeng. The author does this to show that Saeng will adjust and will peservere wheras before she was so upset, @CAPS1 when she said, “I-I failed the test.” Then for Saeng to refound from this event, gave the reader hope and thats why the author did this."
