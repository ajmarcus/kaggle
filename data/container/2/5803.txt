"The author ends the story with that paragraph because she wants to show that the peace that the peace that the flower gave will build her confidence and she will not give up. I know this because in the story the main character fails her driving test and when she sees the flower it helps remind her of the home she had in Vietnam. Another reason is because the flower blooms in spring and it never stops blooming. She knows it will never give up and she relaizes that she shouldnt either. Plus the plant gives her stength to try again. So the reason the author ends her story with that paragraph is to show the power the flower that was know to her, give her and how she will no give up."
