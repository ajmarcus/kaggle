"The cyclit of Do not exceed posted speed limit, was greatly affected by the setting of his bike ride, which caused him pain and displeasure. He travels in the high deserts of California in June, which he exaggerates that water there was @NUM1 degers. The great heat caused him to drink lots of water, depleting it much quicker than he wouldve wished. It also sopped the energy out of him, further complicating his ride. Along the way there is literally nothing there and he has nowhea  to replenish his water supply. The hilly, rough terrain also calls for hard, tough peddling, sopping even more energy. The heat, terrain, and lack of places to stop combined for an awful ride for the cyclist of this story."
