"The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit” has a great effect on the main character in the story. In the beginning of the story, he passes the first ‘town’ and continues riding his bike, following the directions some old folks gave him. “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over it.” His mood at this point was already confident, but this adds to it, with words like “rushing” being encouraging to him. Then, he continues moving on the road. “Not two miles into this section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing.” At this point, he is becoming unsure of how good the directions he obtained really were. Once he is already tired, rolling hills isn’t what he wanted to find, so this adds to his doubt. Further along, he said, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. “This adds to the despair he was feeling, because he feels he is going to die in Yosemite. Not seeing anyone was probably extremely discouraging, so the setting really affected him. Then he said “over the long crippling hill, a building came into view.” It is at this point that he uses the word “crippling” because he is just about exhausted and can’t go any further."
