"In the excerpt ""the Mooring Mast"", the author @ORGANIZATION2 explains some of the obstacles that the builders had to face in their attemp of allowing dirigibles dock on the mast of the Empire State Building.First of all, the dirigibles were big and heavy and needed space to land. @ORGANIZATION2 stated that ""some were... the same length as four blocks in New York City."" If the builders wanted to @CAPS1 dirigibles on top of the building, they would need a lot of space to build a big landing platform for a safe landing.Secondly, the decided that they could not land dirigibles on a flat roof and decided to tie it with a cable tether. The authors says ""the architects could not simply drop the mooring mast on top of the... flat roof."" They realized that the weight of the dirigible would deform the buildings structure and that the strong winds could cause damages down to the foundation of the building.In conclusion, the workers faced many obstacles in order for them to @CAPS1 dirigibles on top of the State holding."
