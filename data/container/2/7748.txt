"The @CAPS1 made the mood in this memoir a nice feeling story and a motivating story. It's nice because of the actual story of the family moving to @LOCATION1, and establishing their own home. The family didn't just live with themselves, it was like all of their friend were like brothers and sisters nobody was excluded from their ""family"". It's motivating because of even if you wern't in their race, they would still lend a hand for people clearly in need. Everybody in the community acted like they were like they were blood related but in reality nobody was. Everybody just cared and love for eachother like parents, brothers and, sisters. The mood in this memoir was it had a nice feeling and it was a motivating story."
