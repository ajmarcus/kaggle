"The Empire State building was built to compete with the Chrysler building and to compete they created a mooring mast. The obstacles that restricted the dirigibles was: nature, the wind changes on top of the building were drastic, and some dirigibles had a large amount of hydrogen which is highly flammable. Another reason why was because it's illegal for aircrafts to fly low over urban areas. The examples above were all complications that restricted the derigibles to moor at the Empire State building."
