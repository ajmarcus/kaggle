"In Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie the setting of the terrain was hot and water draining. In the text it says Followed by blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two-hundred degrees this proves that the cyclist is exagerating about the very hot temperature of the high deserts of California. The setting is also water draining and had to stop in the desert town to refill his water bottle as in the text says I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of a rusted water pump with all my strength.
