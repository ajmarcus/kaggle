Builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One obstacle was finding a way to terner the end of the blimp without it blowing in the wind or putting the people below in danger. Another obstacle was laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. One final obstacle was the danger of hydrogen dirigibles in general. These obstacles proved far to many to outweigh the practicality of the mooring mast.
