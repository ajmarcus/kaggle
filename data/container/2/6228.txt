I think the author concludes like this because its almost like a new beginning. The ending of the story makes you think that Saeng is going to get on with her life. It makes me think that @CAPS1 plans to start her life over in comparison with the hibiscus. Once the plant starts over (rebuds) she will start over once again. It also shows that she is determined to continue on with her life in @LOCATION1. She will not let her life be distraught by her move Vietnam. She hopes that she will be able to start her life over again. The ending is a cliff hanger to show that her story has not yet completely ended. It shows that there is still possibility that she can get on with her life. It also shows she doesnt let her failures control her. She is a strong young woman and is determined to overcome this.
