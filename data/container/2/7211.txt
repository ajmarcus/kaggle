"This memoir had one theme that meant many different things. One theme was helpful. The family moved to the @LOCATION1 from Cuba in 1956 and had many hard ships and struggles. Because they know what it feels like they decisded to help the other struggling people, and let them stay with them; that's exactly what they did. Another theme that I thought fit was inspiration. I think this family not only inspiried their children but other neighbors and other reletives. Last, I think another theme of this excerpt was heart Ð felt. The @CAPS1 Ð @CAPS2 family risked everything to help other families. That's was a very nice action they took on them. One person can slowly make a difference, person by person; that is exactly what this family did."
