In the memoir the author Narciso Rodriguez set a good mood. One thing he did was compare the United States and Cuba. He also made the kids parents seem like very nice people which set a friendly mood. Another thing he did we show how much the kids thanked his parents for making a sacrafice for him. Overall I think Narciso made this story a very cheerful story.
