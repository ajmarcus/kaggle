"The hot, dry, and baron setting affect the cyclist greatly. Baron is a hot, dry and abanded place. The cyclist is trying to ride his bike to Yosemite national park. He decides to follow the directions of coaple old men, which was a mistake.Simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadnt been off their porch in decades,(Kurmaskie). The hot and dry conditions made the cyclists hardest obstacle to be staying hydrated."
