"The author concludes the story with that particular paragraph for a number of reasons. The last paragraph states that when they come back ... I will take the test again, (Ho @NUM1). Already upset about failing her driving test, the main character is upset missing her homeland. The buds of the flowers give her hope and essentially, the strength to take the test over again.

In conclusion, the author chose to end the story with this paragraph because that is what means the most to the main character. "
