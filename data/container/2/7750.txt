"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, created a mood of joy and happyness. It set this mood because he can have a nice and happy life. I think its happy that he can express his feelings to us the reader. The writer makes me feel joyful because it reminds me of what my family is like. ""My parents always had their arms and door wide open to friends and people we consired family."" My mother always has her heart and arms open to anyone who needs to be loved. It is also joyful to know that most of his family will be coming to live with him. The writer tells us about how his grandfather and grandmother will be coming to the United States when they are allowed to leave Cuba. That is the mood the memoir set of me to understand it."
