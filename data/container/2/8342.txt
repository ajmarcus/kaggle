"In the memoir of ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez. The mood of the reading could be described as grateful. I can sense this mood by some of the things Narciso Rodriguez mentions. The author would constantly say ""thank you"" to his parents for all the sacarfies they had to mak for a suitable living enviroment for Narciso. It also states that ""there was no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and demonstration of how important family and friends are."" Over all, in the memoir of @PERSON1 the mood can be mainly described as Grateful towards his parents, heritage and home."
