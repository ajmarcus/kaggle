"In the article The Mooring Mast by @PERSON1 @CAPS1, she describes the difficulties of designing the Mast for Dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State building. Al Smith the mayor of New York City at the time of construction of the Empire State building came up with the idea to add a mooring mast to the top of the building. He wanted to make New York city a technologically advanced city. After the mast was proposed desingners discovered problems with mast being installed. They discovered that they would have to modify the steel frame because if a thousand- foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would transimite stress all the way down the frame to the foundation. due to the load and wind pressure. The wind speeds on the top of the building would blow the dirigible around in the wind, this is very unsafe being close to a building."
