The terrain described in this essay add affect to the strugles of the cyclist. For example when the author says “their were no cars nor buildings in sight” that adds to the affect that he is really out in the middle of nowhere. Also it adds a lot of affect when he comes upon an abandond juice factory and he is so thirsty he puts stones in his mouth to gather saliva. Also when he finally finds water an “oldtimer” asks if he knows the best way to go.
