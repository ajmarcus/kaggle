The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. First of all I think that when the cyclist came across the ghost town he felt alone and discouraged. I think he felt like he was never going to find his way and there was no one there to help him. Also the long hilly highway with nothing but desert on either side basically gave him the discouraging feeling that that road was never going to end and there was no way out of what he had started. I think it made him feel trapped and it was so dry that there was no water in sight and it made him feel so much thirstier than he was. Overall I think that it had really physical and psycoligical effects on him.
