"The mood created by the author is very greatfull and thankful. The author shows how greatful and thankful they are in this memoir When they said, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their Strength and perseverance and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two lessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me With their lives, and those teachings have been the base of my life.""- In my conclusion this is why I think the authors mood in the story is very thankful and greatful."
