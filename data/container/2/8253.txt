"The mood that the author created in the memoir is a very loving and caring one. This is because the author tells what his parents gave up just for him to have a good life. That means his parents really loved him because they wanted him to grow up and have a good life. And that was something that they could find in @LOCATION1. It is very caring of them because when they moved to @LOCATION1 not only did they look after their baby, but other people that needed help as well. To them everyone in their neighborhood was their family and they all looked after each other. The mood is really both loving and caring because it shows how an group of people are so close, that they love and care for each other as one family. No matter what even in hard times one of them will always have their door open for them, and they can always relay on them. That is what family is about."
