"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, the weather in California in June was hot and the water the cyclist found in the pipes was hot, as well. The text says, Somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. This affected him because he had no water to drink from. Another example is when he had to overcome tumbleweeds and snakes. The text states, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. This was an obstacle that he had to overcome. Another example is he was deserted. The text says, no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."
