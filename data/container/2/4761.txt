"The bicyclist was riding to Yosemite National Park and on the way ran out of water. ""The wate bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” Then, hills came into play which makes you more tired and thirsty. “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” The rider didn’t think he would live “I was going to die and the birds would pick he clean” but he found a place to get water “drank deeply from the sink” and finished his ride."
