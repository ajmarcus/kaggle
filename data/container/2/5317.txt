I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph helps bring to story to a closing. In the paragraph she is basically saying when the geese return and my flower is budding I'll be prepared enough to take the test. She'll be prepared because she'll be adapted enough and she'll have experienced enough just like the plant and the geese. She Is comparing her life to the lives of the geese and the life of her flower.
