"The author concludes with this sentence for emphasis. It takes Saeng’s mind off of the flower and she focuses on her test. By waiting until next spring to take the test it gives her something to look forward to. This statement also shows that you should never give up on anything that you do. The author ends on a good note explaining this, The last paragraph is also a break from the rest of the story and from what Saeng‘s was just doing. It is Saeng’s last and final thoughts."
