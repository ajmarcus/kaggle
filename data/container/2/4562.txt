"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. Three features I found were the lack of the water, the heat and the conditions and limits of the road. The lack of water really affected the cyclist. When he was died tried he/she didn’t have anything to drink. The essay stated how would say she/he would save the water til the end. He /she was so tired so the lack of water really affect him/her. The conditions he/she was in really affected the cyclist also. From the beginning he/she was told the wrong directions. That was the reason why he/she was lost the entire time. Finally the limits of the road affected the cyclist. Hills and different grounds did not help the cyclist. In conclusion, the cyclist had many factors affecting him such as lack of water, limits of the road and his/her conditions."
