"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, would be things such as the different usage of air. A sentence I found to follow this reason would be in paragraph @NUM1 when said, ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This would cause many problems and face many obstacles. Another reasoning I found was wind. A reason I found would be as stated in paragraph @NUM2, ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This would be something difficult to fix. As other obstacles I found such as the size and density, I find these two to be the best reasoning."
