"The features of the setting affect the the cyclist by giving him obstacles to overcome when he had to go down the winding hills, he would have to slow down so he could manuver the hills and not lose control of the bike. The heat he was facing would cause tiredness and dehydration. If exposed to the sun and heat long enough you can get a sunburn or suffer a heat stroke. A heat stroke can be fatal to anyone, especially those with heart problems. Dehydration also can be fatal. If the cyclist does not see any buildings, he would not be able to tell where he is and he might get lost because of it. Getting lost will also lead to dehydration, tiredness, and heat stroke."
