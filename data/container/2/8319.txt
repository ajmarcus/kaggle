It is a happy mood because Narciso finally knew what family actually meant.For example when Narciso says ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays, It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" This quote shows the mood that Narciso had wich was happy.In conclusion Narciso had a happy mood because he finally knew the real definition of family."
