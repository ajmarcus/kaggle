"In the memoir, the mood created by the author is very understandable and true. Throughout the memoir the author says how grateful he is for his parents. In the memoir Narciso explains, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso's parents had to go through a lot of hard things. They had to leave their country, their friends and family, and they had to pretty much start their lives over again. But his parents stood strong in those hard times. They cared and taught Narciso many important things. The mood the author sets is very loving. The author had very incredible parents that he is very grateful for."
