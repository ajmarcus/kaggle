"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building had to face a lot of obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that the builders had to face was when they were building the mooring mast to hold the dirigibles. The single cable tether that would hold the dirigibles would add stress to the buildings frame. The builders had to come up with a new idea that would not put stress on the Building. Another obstacle the builders had to face is it would be safe for the passengers. Since the building is so high up the fear of falling out of the dirigible made them worry. One last obstacle that the builders had to face is the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" it made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building. The builders faced many obstacles while building the mooring mast."
