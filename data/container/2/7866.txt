"The authors mood in the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, could be discribed as calm, and a little sad. The author is constantly talking about, and remembering, what her home was like when she was growing up. But, now she is moving away from her beloved home and it makes her sad. Also, she talks about how ""My parents always Kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family."" This would also make her seem sad because maybe her parents died and that's what she remembers about them. As you can see, the authors tone in this memoir is calm, and sad."
