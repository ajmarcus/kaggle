"Many features of the setting affected the cyclist in Rough Road Ahead. First, the scorching heat of the desert  in June was a major problem that had him to the brink of dehydration. In the text it states, I could drop from heatstroke in a gorgeous day in June (@CAPS1). This shows the effect the exposure  to heat had on @NUM1 cyclist. Also, the terrain posed a threat to his well being during the story. In the text it says I toiled on( @CAPS2). This shows the increase in effort in strain the  terrain caused on the cyclist during his adventure."
