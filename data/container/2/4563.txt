"I think that the features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. First, I think the weather conditions affect him. I think this because in the passage it says, I could drop from heatstroke. Meaning, its really hot! Also, l think the fact that he has no water left is affecting him because it says in the passage, l eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. This has a big affect on him, because hes very thirsty. Also, l think the fact that there is nothing around him is affecting him. I think this because in the passage it says there were no cars. I think all these things affect him."
