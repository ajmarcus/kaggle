"I think that the mood created by the speaker is gratitude. I think this @CAPS1 his parents ""unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.)"" This shows that he appreciates his parents passing on their cooking skills. Another example when Narciso is thankful ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 they gave up their jobs of working in a laboratory and chemical engineering to make his life better. This shows that the speaker was creating a tone of gratefulness"
