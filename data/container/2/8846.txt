She describes friends and family with cuban music along with the food here is one example of the food and music ""Passionate Cuban music...filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Another mood is the family and friends. An example of this is in paragraph four where it says ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" And those are some reasons how the @CAPS1 set a mood in The Blueprints of our lives."
