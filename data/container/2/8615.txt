"I think the mood that the author created was a happy mood and a mood that makes you appreciate what you have. And to always remember where you came from, and to always love family. At some points in the memoir the mood become more about @CAPS1, for example in ""paragraph @NUM1"" he tells how his neighborhood growing up was made up of many races including Spanish, Cuban, and Italian, and he tells how they all came together in solidarity and friendship. He also says how his family was always helping each other.In conclusion, I believe the main mood in this memoir would be @CAPS1 and coming together wether it be as a family, or as people."
