"The mood in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is happy and grateful. In ph. @NUM1, Narciso's parents gave up all they had to leave Cuba and come to @LOCATION1 where their children could have a better life. Narciso was so grateful to them that he couldn't express a thank you in words in ph. @NUM2. In ph. @NUM2, it also states that he is really grateful for his parent's love and sacrifice. The reason he is happy, I think is because he has a family that loves him. Even though they're from different cultures they came together and that wouldn't have happened if his parents hadn't immigrated. That is why I think the mood is happy and truely grateful."
