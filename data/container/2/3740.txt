"This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One example is “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” That changes the effect because by saying that it will show how tired he is going to be or the work trying to make it over the hills. Another example would be “high deserts of California in June.” That’s saying its hot outside and very tiring. I think it means that because in California its really hot and in June the “summer time” its very tiring. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.  "
