"The obsticles the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there where the weather, and the Building Frame. The @CAPS1 obsticle was the wind because the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violant air currents. The wind was an obsticle because of a big gust of wind came it could not building materials or even workers off the building. A second obsticle was the building Frame because the dirigible was so big that at the top of the building being held by a single cable, that would add stress to the frame and would make the building unsteady. These are two examples of the obstacles the builders working on the empire state building @ORGANIZATION1 in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
