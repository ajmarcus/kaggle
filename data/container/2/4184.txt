"In Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the terrain has a negative effect on the author. He claims that I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June (Kurmaskie). This shows that he has been drinking his water too fast due to the heat from being in the desert at summertime. After travelling from a long time with no water he lets out a chuckles thinking of how he shouldnt have taken the old mens advise. He explains that It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but atleast I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. This is an example of how badly the terrain had effected him. Its gotten to him so much that he applauds himself for having the energy to feel sorry for himself."
