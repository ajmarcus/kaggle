"There are many ways that the features of the setting affect the cyclist. For example the cyclist was in a very hot and dry place. Meaning there was no water any where to be seen in miles. Also towns were nowhere to be seen for it would be hard to substain life out there. This quote supports there werent many towns, ''About forty miles into the pedal I arrived at the first town.''This shows there aren't many towns in these parts, @CAPS1 so hot and thirsty as the text claims, ''I read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst ''this clearly shows the  man wa very thirsty. Also shows the man was very thirsty. Also @CAPS1 so hot out there the man could see visions as the text states, ''As the looks ofter had been a grape juice factory and bottling plant.'' why would there be a grape juice factory in the middle of no where. Therefore these statements above show how settings can affect ones mind and physical conditions to the cyclist."
