"In the same way the hibiscus flower prevails in the winter saeng wants to be the same way. Saeng failed a test which makes her feel unsuccessful. Saeng wants to prevail she wants to stick it out and the rough times she’s going through make it very difficult for her. When Saeng says “I – I failed the test” this shows that saeng feels disappointe that she didn’t  expect that because she is a fighter, So the author ends the passage with saeng saying” When they come back, in the spring, when snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” To show how much of a fighter Saeng is because she’s determined to strive under difficult conditions."
