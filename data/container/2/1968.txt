"It was unrealistic and also unsafe of engineers to think that they could have dirigibles dock on the building. One major problem with the idea that the dirigible would add stress to the building's frame. Also the weight of the dirigible and the wind pressure would cause a problem for the foundation. Another thing, dirigibles were made up of hydrogen which is highly flammable, and if one of the exploded it would have been a disaster for downtown New York. This is why the idea is neither practical or safe."
