"The mood created in memioar Narciso rodriguez is unity as shown in paragraph @NUM1 ""Our neighborhood was made mostly up of spanish, cuban, and @CAPS1 Immigrants at a time when over racismn was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere. all of these culture came together in a great  solitary and friendship. It was a close knit community of honest hard working Immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind who were clearly in need secondly they had courage as shown in paragraph @NUM2  My mother and my father had come to this country with such courage. Without any knowledge of the language and culture. They came selflessly, as many @CAPS2 due to give their children a better life even though It meant leaving behind their familys frends carrers and the country they loved. That is the mood created by the memiour."
