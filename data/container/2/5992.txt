The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will try the test again and get a fresh new start.  Also I think that its showing the reader if you fail something the first time dont be afraid to go back and try it again. I also think that the hibiscus symbolizes her because she failed the test in the winter and doesnt like what shes in. But in the spring when the hibiscus has buds on it shes going to have a fresh start on the test and the flower will have a new environment to survive in.
