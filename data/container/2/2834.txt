"The builders of the empire state building had to face alot of obsticles to try to get dirgibles to land there. One of those obsticles was making ""changes to existing Plans for the building's stelfame"". Another thing was nature the winds would not let a blimp land there. But the greatest reason was safety: ""Most dirigables from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable""."
