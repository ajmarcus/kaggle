"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez was happy and thankful. His parents taught him many things about their cuban back ground, like cooking and music. His parents gave up many things to comfort Narciso and make him at home. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" His parents turned their house into a home for other People as well. ""My parents always kept their Arms and door open to the many people we considered family."" Narciso's parents would take in anybody that needed a place to stay until they got back on their feet. Narciso's parents were very loving to the community and help out as much as the could in making that place at home."
