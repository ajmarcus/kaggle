The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. The fact that he was in the California desert and the heat affected him because he had limited water and was using his energy riding the bike. The towns he came across also made an impact on him because of the fact that he couldnt get more water or a place to rest. I was doing a water depleating @NUM1 sometimes life can feel so cruel. This shows how the hilly terrain and dehydration and heat are affecting the cyclist.
