"How the setting of the place effects the cyclist is for one its to dry a cyclist would be ridy for haurst shouldn’t be in a place that’s dry.Like in the story it says “I was travelling through the high parts of California in June” meaning it was really hot and dry.Second would be the animals there dangerous.A cyclist should be riding in a place with diamond back snakes it says in the text “I toiled on.At some point,tumbleweeds crossed my path t a ridiculously larger skilt it really did look like adiamond back” which if it really has one would be really dangerous  & cyclist should not be riding in that type of dangerous places no matter what type there are.That is how the settings of the surrandings effect the cyclist & how can it’s a bad place for them to ride."
