"After reading the about story, Winter Hibiscus  by Minfong Ho, I believe the quote, when they come back, Saeng  vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus the budding, then  I will take that test again. Was put in the story for a reason. I believe that this quote concluded the story because it ashamed a tone and feeling of hope. For example, in the story it state that Saeng day out a hole and carefully lowered the plant into it. This shows that this plant areas a lot to here. The story tell the readon that it things lack memories of her grandmother. It represents hope to Saeng because it always brings back happy memories she once had which push here to try to overcome the loss betters. Therefore, the quote concludes the story because it about Saeng will for hope and peace. It represent that when the plant blooms in the spring she will have a new found sense of hope and happiness."
