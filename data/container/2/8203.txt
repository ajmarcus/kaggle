"In the memoir ""Narciso @CAPS1"" by the Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood was happiness because he had his heritage, family and freinds, and the chance to make new lives in @LOCATION2. In paragraph @NUM1 it States ""Skills and love of cooking that is still with me today. Passionate cuban music"". This quote is releavant because it shows that @PERSON2 is happy of his heritage. In paragraph @NUM1 it states ""Family and freinds, and celebrations that encompassed them both."" This quote is relevant to my question because it shows that freinds and family made Narciso happy. In paragraph @NUM3  it States ""In the United States they had to start over entirely taking whatever jobs they can find."" This quote is releavant to my question because it shows that Narciso's family can make whatever they want out of their lives. That is the mood in the memoir ""@PERSON2 @CAPS1"" by Blueprints of Our Lives."
