"In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, he develops a very warm, comforting, and happy mood of where he grew up. Narciso Rodriguez tells us of how his parents came to the states and after living in a small, one room apartment for a while were able to move in to a three room apartment where he was born. He speaks of how is home was decorated in the traditional style, about the Cuban music always playing and of how his parents taught him to cook. Rodriguez also tells us of his diverse neighbor hood but of how they all came together in unity. Everyone cared for one other and they helped whoever was a need. If someone needed help they received it and people would sacrifice for others. The memoir depicts that Narciso Rodriguez grew up in the love of his family."
