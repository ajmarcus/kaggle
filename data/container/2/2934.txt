"In the excerpt written by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, she describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In the excerpt the author told the readers that after building the Empire State Building the builders had to reconstruct the entire building having to make is stronger to support the top. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accomodate this new situation"" (paragraph @NUM1). The workers of the building also had to be working at a height of 1,250 feet. They not only had to rebuild the foundation and strength of the building, but also the top. ""Two months after the workers celebrated framing the entire building, they were back to raise an American flag again - this time at the top of the frame for the mooring mast."" These are just some of the many hardships the workers had to face."
