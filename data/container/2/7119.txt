"The author's interpretation of their childhood home set a mood of love and compassion. He writes about his parents in a way that informs the reader that they were extremely good people. He describes them, as well as others in their community, as honest, hardworking, selfless people. He writes the story with much appreciation of his parents, family, and life, which is very admirable. He describes that he lived in a house with only three rooms, and yet his parents made a home out of it and welcomed others to stay, too. The mood that this author set was that of love and compassion, and he did a very good job of explaining what his childhood home meant to him."
