"A house is not a home without family, and a family is not a family without its trails, struggles, and happiness. The mood in the memoir was to show what family is, that its much more than blood. It's unity, friendship and laughter, its the tears, pain and heartache. Its about how you can start in the slums and work your way up but one thing is never going to change, and that's family. Home doesnt matter about the physical space of the dwelling, but about the relationships and memories you make there. Home is where unity, satisfaction, happpness, and imagination come together in one unorganized way, but it doesnt mean that it won't have trails like racism that almost every minority has to deal with even Narciso Rodriguez dealt with it. I deal with it to, I get called cracker and n**** on a daily baised, I dont know how I would get through it without family."
