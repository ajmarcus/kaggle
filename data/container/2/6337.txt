"By ending the story in the way the author has in the short story Òwinter Hibiscus,Ò the author provides a sympathetic understanding for the reader of seang at her struggle to live in another country & her sadness of wishing to be back home. I think the author was attempting to end the story with a strong feeling for a strong note of Saeng's personality to draw the reader back into what they had just read. For example, by repeating statement on the test saying Ò I will take that test again,Ó the author gives us that understanding that Saeng has not given up & lets the reader know she will stand & live strong."
