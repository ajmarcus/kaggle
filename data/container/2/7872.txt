"The mood of this story is very weird. This story is about different cultures coming together as one. Narciso's parents are very nice and generous. His parents are always taking in @CAPS1 needs a home, and treats them like family. Narciso still has some family in Cuba, and will might be able to meet them until a later time in life. Anyways the mood of this story is very heart-warming, Narciso was also thankful for everything he has, Narciso's parents have a lot of people to feed since, There is more than one family living in their home so It is hard for them. Well I think the mood of the story is great."
