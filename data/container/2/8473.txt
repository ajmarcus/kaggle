"The author creates a mood in this memoir. The author starts off with a mood that is kind of sad. He explains how his parents lived in a one-room apartment when they moved from Cuba to the United States and that there was a lot of segregation going on in the United States. The memoir gets happier as the author describes in paragraph @NUM1 how friendly and close the people living around him were. The hardships of the author's parents are listed in paragraph @NUM2. The fact that they had to start all over again is sadening. The author finishes of in paragraph @NUM3 and @NUM4 with a happy ending. He describes what he has learned from his parents and everything he is grateful for. For example, he learned the true meaning of ""family"". The mood that the author creates is very important to the memoir."
