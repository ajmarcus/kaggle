"There were many obstacles for the builders of the mast attempting to allow dirigibles to dock, such as laws, nature, and overlooked detail. Laws were an obstacle because of safety risks of having a dirigible over a densely populated area, such as the Hindenburg accident. Nature was a problem because of the violent winds at the top of the mast, which would make the ship unsteady. The last obstacle was that the builders of the mast overlooked all the other obstacles, and safety risks."
