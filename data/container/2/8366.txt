The mood created by the author in the memoir is a very happy mood. The author's parents gave up everything to come to @LOCATION1 for their soon to be child. They did that so that he could have a better education and for that he is verry greatful. The author loved his home and had great times in their. It is his most favorite place in the whole world and that is why he talks about his home in great detail. The author had great family memories in the kitchen with Cuban music and the scent of Cuban food. The author's mood is gratefull. It is because for what his parents did for him by moving to Cuba. It also is happy because of all the great times he had there. The author would probably want to relive those times as I want to relive  times of my childhood.
