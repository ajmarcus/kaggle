"The features of the setting on the way to Yosemite National Park, greatly affected the cyclist. On the way to the park, the cyclist had encountered the heat of the desert in California. Besides the heat the cyclist had to overcome the rough terrain of the of the short, rolling hills. This made the cyclist tired and weary. Adding to his weakness, and the extreme heat, he also ran out of water, causing him to become dehydrated. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke...laugh. This trip through the California desert greatly affected the cyclist by causing great exhaustion and dehydration."
