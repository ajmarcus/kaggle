"In the short excerpt, The Mooring Mast By Marcia Amidon Lsted there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. An obstacle they faced was the space. An example ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" @CAPS1 saying it was going to be hard finding a place to land. Although that may had been one of their problems that was not the only problem it was the safety. The excerpt says, ""the mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service and to let passengers off and on."" Which meant it would have taken along time just land and fueling. Another obstacle was for the dirigibles to be tested in the testing of the mast"
