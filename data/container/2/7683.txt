"The mood created by the author in the memoir is being together. This mood is created by saying how his parents created a traditional cuban home in New Jersey. Also, when he said that that his parents always kept open arms and door. I think that ment that they were willing to let people stay with them and help them out when they were having a hard time. Also, when he said that everyone in the neighborhood despite there customs came together in friendship."
