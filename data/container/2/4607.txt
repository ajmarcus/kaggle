"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First, the heat made the cyclist overheated. For instance, the weather was sunny in June. Also, the hills made the cyclist very tired. For example, the cyclist was losing energy and had to keep pushing. Lastly, the setting had no places that could have helped the cyclist. For instance, the cyclist had trouble finding a place with water to drink. In conclusion, the setting affected the biker in a very negative way."
