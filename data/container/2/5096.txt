"The main affect is the lack of water. It is in June, while riding his bike in California. Therefore it’s going to be very hot and he’ll need a lot of water t stay hydrated. When he sees that Welch’s Grape Juice factory, it just makes him think of his thirst even more. Also the terrain he is riding is not the easiest. He starts out riding on flat ground but then is riding on hills and not so flat terrain. This doesn’t help his dehydration. That’s why you should always carry a lot of water with you if you’re riding a bike during the summer"
