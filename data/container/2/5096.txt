"The main affect is the lack of water. It is in June, while riding his bike in California. Therefore its going to be very hot and hell need a lot of water t stay hydrated. When he sees that Welchs Grape Juice factory, it just makes him think of his thirst even more. Also the terrain he is riding is not the easiest. He starts out riding on flat ground but then is riding on hills and not so flat terrain. This doesnt help his dehydration. Thats why you should always carry a lot of water with you if youre riding a bike during the summer"
