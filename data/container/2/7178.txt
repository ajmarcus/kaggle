"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez a certain mood is created by the author. The mood is happiness and joyfulness because in this memoir the author continues to talk on about his family a culture which is a perfect reason for the mood to be happy. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" this quot was found in @CAPS1 @NUM1, this quot also shows that his family was kind and generous. This mood involved the familys culture which Narciso loved so much. His beautiful culture was just another piece of the puzzel that fit together, and that last quot ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house in to a home"" found in @CAPS1 @NUM2 really puts every thing together touching the reader emotionally."
