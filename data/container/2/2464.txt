The builders faced many obstacles while building a mast for dirigibles on the Empire State building. One was that the had to strengthen the foundation so that all the stress on the buildings structure wouldn't tear it apart. Also the fact it was impractical for a dirigible mast because shifting currents and winds would either make it impossible to land or would circle the blimp around and hit buildings. The workers faced these obstacles and finally realized that they couldn't do it.
