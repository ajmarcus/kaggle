"In Winter Hibiscus the author concludes the story the way he does to show that Saeng isnt giving up. In the spring she will see the plant and remember her home which will help her not feel as homesick. Plants she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood work. This quote shows that when she sees familiar plants she is reminded of home, so in the spring when her plant blooms she will see it and feel more comforting and more at home which will help her find the strength to pass the driving test. So as the plant blooms, so does her comfort level."
