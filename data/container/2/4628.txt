"The setting in Do Not @CAPS1 Posted speed limits affects the mood of the cyclist in that every time the setting changes the mood of the cyclist changes. In the begining of the story the cyclist is riding through the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite. @CAPS2 this time the cyclist is enjoying his trip and is in a positive mood. As the story goes on there was no one in sight, not a building, a car, or structure of any land. At this point in the story the cyclist has exchanged his positive mood for a desperate one as his water begins to run out."
