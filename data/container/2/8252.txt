"The author creates a unique mood in the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives. The mood is loving/caring/kind from what the authors saying about his memories. It is loving because he is talking about all the close relationships he had with his family and friends. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" The mood was also sad because throughout the whole thing he was saying thank-you to his parents for all his oper tunities. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Also another mood is happy, happy from all the great memories. He talks about all his family and friends hangin' out and having a great time.
