"The setting for the cyclist is a hard and dangerous one. He had little water, and his area had tough terrains. I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June (@NUM1). He is dehydrated and he still has a long way to go. I went on a bike ride that was many miles long  in @LOCATION2, and we did not have water because we could not take a break. The terrain was tough, just like the authors terrain. The camel he was in was affecting his brain, and he just wanted to get it over with. I am just glad I dont have to bike in that terrain.  "
