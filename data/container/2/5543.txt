"  In the article the author concludes the story with Saeng vowing to herself that in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is bidding, then I will take that test again because the spring and the hibiscus reminds her of home. For example in the article she gets shaky because she cant say home because she misses it too much. So she finds things that reminds her of it like a plant called dok faeng-noi. Its not the real plant but she gets it to remind her where she comes from. In conclusion, Saeng finds a plant, she likes the soring because it reminds her home. How about what reminds you of home. Think about it."
