"In the memoir, the author creates a mood. The feeling, or mood, that I think that the author is trying to create is a very grateful mood. I say this because that author is talking about how he is grateful, or thankful, to his parents for teaching him things and for bringing him up in a home and neighborhood that was very united and close."
