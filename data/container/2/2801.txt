There was one major problem with the dirigibles docking on the Empire State Building. This major problem was that the mooring mast is so high up in the air and downtown New York where The Empire State Building is located is such a crowded area. If something goes wrong it will affect a huge area because New York is such an urban area. It is a good idea but Al Smith did not take all the precautions that he needed to. Because if something does go wrong a lot will go wrong because downtown New York is such a crowded area. Thats the main obstacle that the builders had to overcome with letting dirigibles dock on the mooring mast of the Empire State Building.
