"In the story Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho. I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it emphasiseS that Saeng is willing to retake the test when it comes back. I also think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the story the @NUM1 to last paragraph says, Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quite repititon of the season upon season, almost farmiliar to her now. This sentence shows me that @PERSON1 is slowly getting used to the new place. Also how she is changing her mind about the pLant and the fact that even though its not the same, it can still have meaning. Therefore, I think the author made a good choice in ending the story with this paragraph.   "
