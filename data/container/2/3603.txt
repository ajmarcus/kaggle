"Some features of the setting affect the cyclist. First the cyclist followed the old codgers advice of how to get to Yosemite National Park. Their advice was no use and didnt help her in the end. Next, “a tarlike substance oozed out” of what she thoot was going to be water. Then the terrain changed to “short, rolling hills”, which wasnt helping, her bike better. Lastly, ""tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake”, slowed her down. All of these road blocks in the setting affected the cyclist."
