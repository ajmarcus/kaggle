"The author concludes the story, ”Winter Hibiscus,” with that paragraph because it sums up everything the hibiscus has given Saeng for strength and courage. Just like the hibiscus, Saeng felt out of place in this new country and the hibiscus helps her realize the importance in adapting to her survival in order to live happily. She can’t alway be dwelling in the past but learn to like where she lives now. Therefore, when the author writes, “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” it is a direct symbol of Saeng budding or opening her mind to the @CAPS1 ways, like learning to drive.
