"The mood Created by the author in the memoir is grateful, happy. The reason I say that because if my parents did that I should be very grateful because they did all this for me to be happy and for me to have a better life. ""And for which I am eternally grateful"". ""They Came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their Children a better life"". Wow that @CAPS1 alot from his/her parents they are very strong and they did all for their children to be happy. This is the reason why I picked those two mood in the memoir!"
