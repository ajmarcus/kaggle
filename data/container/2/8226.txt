"The author creates many moods in the story. While reading this story I felt happy, sometimes sad and overall it made me feel good.The mood that the author is trying to sel is happieness and unity. even though many cultures and ethnic backgrounds were in his neiborhood they all came together as one. Then at other times I felt sad because he grew up with racism still in america. The story makes me feel good because the author is trying to say that it is not the materialistic things that make you happy it is the family and freinds that surroud you every single day."
