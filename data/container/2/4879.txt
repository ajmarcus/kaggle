"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him thirsty and him thinking he is lost and going to die. The cyclist got information from an old guy that has not been off his porch for years. Just when the cyclist thought he was lost he saw Gary and Wilbers fish camp-if you want bait for the big ones, were your best bet! The cyclist went in and got water, and the old man asked him if he wanted to know where to go, but this time he said no."
