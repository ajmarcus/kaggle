"In many stories the narrator uses a dramatic yet conclusive statement to end the story. An example of one such occurrence is in the short story Winter Hibiscus. In the story the young girl finishes of by telling us when she will be taking her test again, although not directly to us as it says Saeng vowed silently to herself but it still informs the reader. The reason the author includes this last vowe is to inform not only the reader of the future but to show the girls determination and spiritual connection with the plant. For example, when it says and this hibiscus is budding its showing the girls connection with the plant because of the comfort and canfidence it given her, ecpecially since she needs to take the test. In conclusion the narrator concluded the story with the paragraph to show future events and to illustrate the spiritual connection the girl was with her the flower and the homeland."
