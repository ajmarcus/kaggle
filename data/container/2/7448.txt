"The author shows many moods while writing this memoir, like gratitude, happiness, and love. The main mood in this memoir however is gratitude. @ORGANIZATION1 is very grateful for everything his parents have ever done for him and he loves them with all his heart. Also he is grateful for how they always made him safe. In the last sentence Narciso says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."", what this means is that he is greatful for the life he had. So he will never forget the gratitude that fills him up inside."
