"According to the excerpt from @ORGANIZATION2's ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. When Al Smith was first planning the structure and use of the mass, he seems to be overambitious. In paragraph @NUM1, the reader gets the sense of how competitive Smith was, which is a quality that can get in the way of practicality. Smith's determination to have the Empire State Building be the tallest was an obstacle because it was what first initiated the idea of the mooring mast. Although it is made clear to the section ""Designing the Mast"" that a lot of planning went into the building of the mast, the extra effort needed for this was an obstacle as well. The mast delayed completing the whole building and as @PERSON1 says in paragraph @NUM2, the mast caused unsolved problems and postponements. A significant reason to the failure of the mast was the issue of safety because the dirigibles were highly flammable. As it also says in paragraph @NUM3, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" These both show the impracticality of the installment of a dirigible dock, revealing the largest obstacles the builders faced. Because ambition was more important than practicality in the building of the mooring mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles and failed."
