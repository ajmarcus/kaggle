"The builders of the Empire state building faced a few obstacles during there attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles were the structure of the building. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether. This would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would, ""have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"", which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The Steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new Situation."
