"I believe that the author concludes the story this way to snow that Saeng  will be of next year . She  said now all the new  @CAPS1 things seemed  weird to her when she first got here , but now  they are second nature to her now  . I think that  the  hibiscus is an can of  hope and inspiration to her . I  think  that she finally realizes  that  she  is in  @LOCATION1 to stay  and  she  can  go  back to  vietnam . So she has to accept  that  she  is  here home  and I think she  is  on her  way  to  doing  that ."
