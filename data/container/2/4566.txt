"Heat, abandoned roads, snakes all are reasons that affected the cyclist. The heat made him get dehydrated faster while he was using energy. The long abandoned roads further increased his doubt of living the whole bike ride. He used up allof his water. So when he got to the old pump hot dirty water came out. The snake in the story made the journey for this guy perilous and deadly. This all happened because he listened to the old guys. When the other old guy was about to tell him whereto go he said no."
