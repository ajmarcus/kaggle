"In the memoir, @PERSON1, from Home: The blueprints of our lives, there was a very solidary mood. The @PERSON1 family was so happy to be in @LOCATION1 and be free, and no longer in Cuba. It was a very loved environment with friends and family always coming to their table. They were a very caring family. They always had the arms and door wide open to other refugees until They got back on their feet. They were a happy, loving, and caring @CAPS1 family."
