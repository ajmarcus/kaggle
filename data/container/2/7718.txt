"This memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" is very enjoyable. The mood made it really easy to understand and read.The mood of this story is not funky or funny. The mood is like haveing a regular conversation with a person. I like when the author adds little perenthesis, it gives it a personal touch and adds more of a conversation touch to the mood. For example in paragraph @NUM1, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)."" Its more of a fun fact or personal note.In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" has a very formal mood, with a personal twist. The formal mood makes the memoir easy to understand, while the personal twist makes the story enjoyable to read. This is how to use mood correctly."
