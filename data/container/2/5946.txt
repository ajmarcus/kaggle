"When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. is the paragraph that the author uses to conclude the story. In the my opinion the author includes this paragraph to conclude the story in order to show Saeng is committed to adjusting  to her new home and to leaving her old one. For example, in the story Saeng was unable to say I mean, not like the kind we had at home. without bursting into tears. This illustrates her sorrow and inability to let go of her past."
