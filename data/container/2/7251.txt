"In this excerpt from the book ""Home: the blue prints of our lives"" Narciso Rodriguez describes his first home in @LOCATION1. The feeling of this story is first loving with how @CAPS1 explains his parents sacrifice ""they-came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This story also gave a feeling of closeness and how ""family had nothing to do with being a blood relative' @CAPS1 and his family opened up there house to many people. This story also gave a warm feeling by the story of his family celebrating together in paragraph seven. Overall the story had a happy mood to it showing love, kindness, and what a family should be like"
