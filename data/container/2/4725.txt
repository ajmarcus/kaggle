"The setting of the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" is very important to the events that occured in the  story. For example the story was set on a  highway set at @NUM1 which the cyclist was only able to do @NUM2. This is signifigant to the events of the story because since he was doing @NUM2, which by the away is a lot for a cyclist and it led to almost dehydration. Plus it was hilly. This led to the excution of the cyclist, so one could see that setting is very important to the outcome of the story."
