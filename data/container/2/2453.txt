"Based on the information given in the excerpt, the obsticals that the builders of the Empire State Building had to face were critical to the usage of the dock. Not only is it a challenge to build 102 story building but when factoring in wind and other weather conditions it is not an easy task: In order for the builders of the Empire State Building to create and hoist the dock the top they needed to first reinforce the skeleton of the building itself. ""The Architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" (paragraph @NUM1) @CAPS1 constructing the mooring mast the builders had to think about the violent wind speeds and the structure of the building to support itself. There were many obsticals that the builders of the Empire State Building had to work through to complete their project."
