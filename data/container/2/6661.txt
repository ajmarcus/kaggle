"The Author includes this paragraph to this story in many reasons why. One reason why is because the story started off by saying and talking about Saeng failing her drivers test and being depressed over it. Then it gets into talking about the hibiscus and how it reminds her of homeland and all of the good memories that she has experienced. This all relates to this paragraph because Saeng will not return to the testing again until the thing that makes her happy and confident, the hibiscus starts to bud. That paragraph relates to every little bit of this story from the beginning to the end."
