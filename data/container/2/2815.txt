"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems when realizing the idea of letting dirigibles dock there. First off @CAPS1 is a major concern many Blimps were filled with Hydrogen which is extremely explosive. Second off the winds at the top of the tower were very strong, making docking terribly difficult if not impossible. Lastly, it was illegal; in New York there was a law forbidding @CAPS2 from flying to low, and to dock on the building it would fly in illegal airspace. The main obstecals the builders faced were @CAPS1 concerns, high winds and the illegality of thier project."
