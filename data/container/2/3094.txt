"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were mostly due to the dangers of violent winds at such an altitude that may cause the aircraft to crash either into the building or down to the ground. For example two blimps attempted the docking and one of them could not come close to the building because of winds. The other was able to deliver a bundle of newspapers hoisted down by a rope. In conclusion, the main problem was the unstability of the aircraft being docked."
