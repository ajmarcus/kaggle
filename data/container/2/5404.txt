"The author concludes the end; of the story the way he/she did because it shows how much the plant truly means. S'aeng is going to wait till the flower blooms because it means so much to her. The flower represents her and her driving test. When the hibiscus is ready to bloom, she will be ready to drive. The plant gives her hope for a new tommorow, a new chance. The last paragraph helps the reader realize how much the plant means to the girl, its significance. It makes her feel more at home, and her home makes her feel stranger; makes her joyful and happy after the misery of failing the driving test."
