"Theres many features of the setting that affect the cyclest. His dehidration started with the sun beeting down on him and the thirst for water. He was mainly affected when he was out of water and road by an abbanond welchs grape juice factory. A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head. Then when he had almost nothing left he spoted a bait shop. Somehow I climed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope. Then, as easily as rounding a bend my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me. @CAPS1 is when he saw Gary and @CAPS2 Fish camp  If you want bait far the big ones were your best bet thus realcaving his troubles."
