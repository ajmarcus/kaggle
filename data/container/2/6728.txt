"The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a couple of different reasons. The author wants to show with meaning, that the budding of the hibiscus plant will be symbolic. Ho states, Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits, This shows meaning because it is currently a point in time where Saeng has to overcome negative circumstances, and with the plant dead it shows symbolically the meaning of the plant. At another point in the story, Saeng realizes that there is much more meaning to the seasons, Ho states, Through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now, she is realizing that come spring time when the plant will be healthy and budding, she will be able to succeed and become somehow like a new person."
