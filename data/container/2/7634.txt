"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in this excerpt from his memoir ""Home: The @CAPS1 of our lives"" is a very comfortable one. He uses words like ""warm"" (@CAPS3 @NUM1), and ""Close-knit"" (@CAPS3 @NUM2). He shows us, how welcome his house was in @CAPS3 @NUM3, @CAPS2 ""Countless family members came and went."" In @CAPS3 @NUM4, he tells how his Family immigrated ""Selflessly... to give their children a better life."" And they did, because in @CAPS3 @NUM5 the author says ""It was in the warmth of... this humble house... where I learned the real definition of 'family'."""
