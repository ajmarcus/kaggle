"There was a number of things that affected the cyclists during his travel. First off, at the old town there wasn’t any real water he could drink. So he was out of water and was going to be thirsty. Also, it’s the middle of June in California, it’s very hot and size and the is going to wear him out pretty quickly. Another thing that affected the cyclist is the steep hills he has to go up and down. For example, he says “Over one long, crippling hill”, he’s saying the hills are very hard for him. Those are the features that affected the cyclist in the story."
