"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that he was happy. One way is ""My mother and fathe had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. they came selflessly, and many imigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind ther families, friend and carrers in the country they loved"". For example he was @CAPS1 of what his Parents did by coming to @CAPS2 with such carange. Second way is ""I will always be grateful to my parent for their love and sacrifice"". For example you always thanks your parent when they do something for you. The is how the author describes his mood."
