"The author of this story created quite a mood in these few paragraphs. As I read this I could feel a warm welcoming from home. The mood would have to be greatful and happy. Feelings of which we are expected to feel on @CAPS1. The author talks about his kind parents and loving family. About how his parents was so selfless, and would always lend a hand to anybody needed help, matter who they were. He also talked about his loving neighborhood, and not blood related families. I believe the author created a great mood that reminds you of home and makes your heart smile."
