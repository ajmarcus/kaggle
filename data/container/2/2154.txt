"The obstacles of getting the dirigibles to be able to dock at the empire state building was, they couldn't put the fuell on top of the building. Putting mooring mast on top of the roof would make it very unstable and putt a lot of Pressure on it. For this to happen they had to modify the structure of the roof, which ended up costing over @MONEY1. After succefully building that they had another obstacle. It was trying to figure out how the dirigibles wouldn't move around with so much wind currents. They never figured out how and the idea just disappeared."
