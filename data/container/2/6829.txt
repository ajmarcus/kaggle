"The author concluded the story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. Saeng believes that if the hibiscus can survive through hard times and adapt to changes, and survive she can also. Saeng icoms that even though she has moved to the United States and it is different she is strong enough to survive. Failing her drivers test dosent mean that she is incapable of anything, but trying again with a fresh start like the hibiscus."
