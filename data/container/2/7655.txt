"The mood the author created was a peaceful mood. She was bringing up good memories of her past life in her home. She was saying how she was eternally greatful for everything her parents gave her and taught her. Her parents tought her much about her heritage when she was young and kind, she lived in a very diverse area growing up there were Spanish, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. There were times of racism and violence. The overall mood she created in this memoir was sad, happy and peaceful."
