"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he cant go any farther because of the hills, and the snake. When he finds the bait shop hes relieved. He relieved because he can get something to drink. He can also buy the worms to eat. The cyclist didnt really know where he was going because there wasnt a car, building, or structure in sight. So the cyclist just keeps on riding until he comes across the bait shop or the first town as he calls it in the essay. When he comes across the road that has 55 mph per limit, and hes only 12 he knows that hes not going anywhere near Yosemite National Park."
