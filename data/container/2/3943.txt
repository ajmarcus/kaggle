"In the essay, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the cyclist encountered several problems. The main conflict of the cyclist in this text is the lack of water. Cycling is a vigorous exercise and can take much strength out of a rider. Water is neccesary to make sure the cyclist stays hydrated. In the text, the old men had the cyclist take a detour through desert areas and hilly terains. Because of the hot weather and rough roads the cyclist became dehydrated faster than normal. For  example, the text says, ""The water bottles contained only a few tentalizing sips, wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatsroke on a gorgeouse day in June."" @CAPS1, by usings vocubulary such as ""tentalizing"" expresses the cyclist need for water. Furthermore, later in the sentence the narrator make a reference to the old men, giving the blame entirely to them for them suggesting the path. Readers can also can conclude that the harsh setting of the essay greatly affected the cyclist"
