"The features of the setting affect to cyclist because of where he is. The biker is in a campground in California. By saying that one could sense it is a dusty place. Also, when the story says that the town had been abandoned. This also tells us that the place the cyclist is in is a diserted place without many people or places to stop. The story also talks about a snake in the road. A snake in the road tells one that the town is desireted I could tell that this town is deserted because around here, people do not goin towns that don`t have buildings. It a snake was in the road, then the town must be empty because around here streets are busy and no snakes in the road."
