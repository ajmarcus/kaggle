One example of this is when the author states ""she relazed that many of the things that she had thought of as strange befor had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost fimilar to her now. This means that with every season she get more used to her new home and if became more like her and with every season. Another is when the author says she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading to the distance. This reminds her of her old home watching the geese."
