"In ""Narciso Rodriguez from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" there is a proud, happy mood. This memoir is all about heritage and the home. When he talks about his heritage he speaks about his food, home, and music that gives the reader a sense of pride. This is also a happy sort of memoir because it talks about the unity of the neighborhood despite the fact that they are all from different parts of the world,"
