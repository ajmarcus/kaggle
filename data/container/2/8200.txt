"In the memoir, the author emphasized a very specific mood. She greatly emphasized warmth and safety. By warmth, she meant that you were always surrounded by loved ones. It meant something you'll always remember, because it's such a remarkable feeling. By stressing this warmth, it meant that it created memories. The other part of this mood was safety. The explanation of the safety was that you're surrounded by people that care about you, and there's no one to judge you, no one to hurt you, and you're safe from any dangers. I personally love the mood of this story because it's something I long for each @DATE1 down thecape. In conclusion, the mood of the memoir is very clear."
