"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from the book ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" The author was very happy and grateful. I know he is happy in this memoir because in paragraph @NUM1 he writes ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" This is a happy setting where the author grew up in. The author was also very grateful to his parents. I know this because in paragraph @NUM2 he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. This shows the emotions the author felt growing up."
