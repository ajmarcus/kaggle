"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building. Because it was held by a Single Cable tether that would add Stress to the buildings frame. Another obstacle was that dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted to the Building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. Even though, the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and Strengthened to accommodate this new Situation. Overall, this cost over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications."
