"In ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted, the Empire State Building is familiar to many people throughout the world, but not many know that the original purpose of the mast was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles, also known as blimps. Do to the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, they eventually shelved the idea. One of the obsticles the builders realized that if a forign dirigibles were to dock and have an accident with any heat or a spark, they would explode and fall to the ground, killing many men, women, and children, due to the chemicals that are used on forign dirigibles. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" @CAPS1, another obsticle they faced violent winds, that would knock the dirigibles around. ""Winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" All in all the obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirgibles to dock eventually shelved the idea."
