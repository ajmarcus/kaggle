The @CAPS1 of the Empire State building faced many Problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of the problems are some blimps are filled with hydrogen wich is highly flammable. If a blimp with hydrogen in it exploded over @LOCATION1 that would not turn out so good For people in New York City. Those people could die. Also one one blimp exploded in New Jersey the blimp had hydrogen in it. So when that happened they thought a lot about the docking station and only to allow blimps with helium in them to dock there.
