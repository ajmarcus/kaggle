"The mood of this story is happy, hopful, and caring. In some paragraphs, the mood shifted and felt upsetting and gloomy (p @NUM1) ""They struggled both personally and financially."" At these parts in the memoir it felt sad and hopless to see what struggles they faced. But then it shifted. Narciso used words like, ""courage, selflessly, love, family, and celebration."" This transformed this memoir to an exciting and happy story. They never gave up hope and all the imagrents helped eachother with their problems. This is set a mood of selflessness, and caring which is what the Rodriguez family brought to the United States."
