"The mood of the author and the memoir was happy. He or she seemed proud of everything about theirselves. He or she didn't let anyone stand in their way of their culture, home, and parents. For example the author said ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" When i read that last sentence of the whole memoir I understood what feeling the author was getting. He or she was in all kinds of moods. Some was happy, some was grateful, and some was exciting. The mood the author was in made me realize that I need to appreciate what I got. In my home, in my school, everywhere and everyone around me. The mood of the author in the memoir was grateful. and happy."
