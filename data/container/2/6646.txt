"Authors sometimes conclude a story with a certain paragraph describing an action that will take place in the future. In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author concludes the paragraph by saying “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” One reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to help show that things will change come spring. For example in the story the girl saids “I-I failed the test.” By her saying this and talking about how she failed her driving test come spring she can change. She can get better, so that this time she will pass. Also, “The ""winter hibiscus” was in the ground now, and @CAPS1 tamped down the soil around it.” This quote helps show that the hibiscus is being planted now, but come spring it will have changed color and have bloomed. In conclusion authors end stories with a paragraph like this to help show the changes that could happen in the future."
