"The feeling in this article when it talks about family is love, peace, happiness, and gratefulness. Narciso understands that his parents left everything in Cuba for him. @CAPS1 could tell that his parents love him very much and @CAPS1 is grateful for that. In paragraph @NUM1 @CAPS1 states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 has the opportunity to be born in @LOCATION1 and having a better life. Narciso also learned that @CAPS1 could love a non blood relative because they could be his family too. There were many people that were like family to him. @CAPS1 loved them and they were happy spending time with each other. In this memoir the mood would most likely be happy and loving."
