"The mood of the author is @CAPS1 and grateful because his parents left Cuba and were very nice people. They let people live at there house. When the didnt have much money, the took any job the could get so they could care there son, Narciso, they had a three bedroom apartment and they let refugees celebrate their arrival to this country, they also had there house full of love and life. Also they came to this country with not knowing how to speak this language. So the mood of this story at the author seems to be proud."
