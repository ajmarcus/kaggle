"The author could have put alot of different types of mood in the memoir. I think that the mood of the memoir is happy, greatful and appreciated. I said happy because he talks about every thing he does and how he enjoys it I said greate because he is always thanking his parents and he admires them. He admires them because thy have comed last to the good life and they do everything in their power to have a good life. An he appreciates him because of the same thing I said before he admires them and always thank them for what they have done to her. This is the mood the authors has toward writting the story."
