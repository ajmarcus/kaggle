"When the builders of the Empire State Building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there, they came across many issues. One is the stress on the building from the added mast. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all they way down to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" @CAPS1 how the stress factors on the building troubled its construction. Another obstacle to its construction was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". When building the dock, constructors ran into issues which eventually overcame them and led to its uselessness."
