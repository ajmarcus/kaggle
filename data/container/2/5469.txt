"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" the author Minfong Ho concludes the story with that paragraph because it was a way of saying shes going to forget about what happen in the past with her failing her test and shes going to do better the next time. Its like the author is saying she will be reborn again like the hibiscus, when the spring comes. Through the story Saeng had to adjust just like the hibiscus. And the hibiscus inspired Saeng to do well where shes at. So its a new beginning to Saeng, after all her learning from hibiscus."
