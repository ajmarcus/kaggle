"The mood created by the author in the memoir is nice and happy. I think the mood is nice and happy because @ORGANIZATION2 shows @CAPS1 for his parents, grandparents, and his house. Another reason I think the mood is happy and nice is because the passage talks about @ORGANIZATION2's hometown, culture, and etc. It also talks about what he is grateful for and that would be his parents, and passionate Cuban music. In conclusion that is what I think the mood is which is nice and happy in the story Narciso Rodriguez."
