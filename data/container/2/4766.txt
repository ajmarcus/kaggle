"No water, rough terran, bad info-all are reasons why the boy isn’t doing so well I said no water because he is dehidrated but needs to soae his water. Also he could die from heat exauston. I also said rough terrain because he could fall and get hurt with no one around to help. And to top it off he took info from old people that didn’t know what they were talking about. Theas leave all examples about the essay that support my writing."
