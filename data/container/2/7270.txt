"The memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" creates a very warm peaceful and interesting mood. The way the author described the way she used to live looks like she lived a very loving and peaceful enviroment. She also creates a spanish theme to it which I could relate to. For example in paragraph @NUM1 she says she is very passionate for Cuban music and she's grateful she know how to cook. She also said in paragraph @NUM2 she will never forget how her parents turned a simple house into a home. That quote makes the mood of the memoir loving."
