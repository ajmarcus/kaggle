"The mood created by the author is respectful. The mood is respectful because They came from cuba and went to @LOCATION1. as the @CAPS1 says ""My Mother And father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture"". Another reason why the mood is respectful is that the Mother and father went to this country for their child. As the @CAPS1 says ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" This shows that they moved for the kid and not For themselfs."
