The author of Winter Hibiscus concludes the story with that paragraph because it gives a sense of starting over and a new beginning for Saeng. The hibiscus is a reminder of her home country and it keeps her going and strong and she compares herself to the geese saying that things she thought were strange became familiar through a quiet repetition from season to season. In the winter the hibiscus doesn’t bloom and Saeng fails her driver’s test. That paragraph tells that in the spring when the Hibiscus thrives and the geese return it will be a fresh start for them and Saeng as well.
