"In the excerpt, the author creates a loving mood. It mentions that Narciso will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrafice. That's telling us they get along well and really care for eachother. And then there is his siblings that live in different parts of the apartment. They help set the table and eat with them so I can tell they are all really loving and caring and all enjoy being a family together. This why I believe the author is creating a loving, and peaceful mood."
