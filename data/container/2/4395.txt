"There are many features of the setting that effect the cyclist. One feature is that it is getting hotter and it will eventually effect him. The line I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasnt a mirge. shows that the heat  might be starting to effect him. Another feature is that he is in the desert and running low on water. The line I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly shows that he is drinking a lot of water and is running low. Another feature is that he is riding in the high deserts of California in June. The story says and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. Not only is it in June, but it adds heat because he is also in a desert. There is no doubt he will get dehydrated. Those are some of the many features that effect the cyclist."
