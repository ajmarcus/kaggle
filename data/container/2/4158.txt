"Many things about the setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist. The terrain in this story is hilly and filled with deserts.

Not to mention while he is severely dehydrated, and when he finds the water it is “tarlike” and ""in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees”.
