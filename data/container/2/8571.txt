"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy and good thoughts. Narciso tells us what it was like growing up. She gives us the idea that her and family were really close. She expresses to us how proud she is to be Cuban in many ways. Narciso tells us she enjoys cooking and so do her parents. She loves listening to Cuban music also. Narciso lived in a traditional Cuban home. Her home was not just a simple home, her parents created it into something more meaningful, something more special."
