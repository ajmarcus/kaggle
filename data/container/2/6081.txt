"Saeng is not comftorable in her sorryndings, and has not addapted to the changes from where she moved. She finds the hibiscus and choses to go buy it, because it reminds of her home in @LOCATION2. When she brings it home  her mother seems shocked at first by the price saeng had paid, but is then more sympathetic when she realizes she misses @LOCATION2. Sheang says she is going to retake her test in the spring. She is also implying that she is going to change her attitude about living in @LOCATION1."
