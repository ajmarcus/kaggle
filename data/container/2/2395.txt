"Based on the excerpt the builders faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. As in paragraph @NUM1 ""the greatest reason was safety."" The most important issue was the blimps used hydrogen which was highly flamibale. An accident would of been tragic because of the heavily populated downtown @CAPS1. Also nature proposed a big obstacle as well ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" @CAPS2 there was an existing law against flying airships to low over urban areas."
