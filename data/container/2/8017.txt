"In the memoir the mood that was created by the @CAPS1 was saying Family is the most important thing in life. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifise. That means he is saying that he will always love his parents and his family. The @CAPS1 is trying to say that it is better to have family than money because in this memoir it talks about his parents leaving Cuba with no money no job but for them being together it gave them hope and now they live in a @NUM1 room house with their family. With out family life would be much harder to deal with."
