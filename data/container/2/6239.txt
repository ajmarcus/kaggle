"I think the author concludes the story like that because its showing the time that will be passing. When it shows time passing, shes grew up more and maybe shell be ready to take the test since now she knows how it is. Also because the hibiscus will be budding, that will make her feel more comfortable and relaxed because it all make her feel more like secure home feeling. hibiscus is budding this way the flower will be starting new and so will she."
