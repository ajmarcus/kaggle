"The features of the setting affect the cyclist is that on his way he had to deal with so many things. Like for ex he had trouble with the flat roads that was replaced by short, rolling hills. The next thing was there was a sign that was posted he could not ride @NUM1 he had to do @NUM2 and that made him disappointed. Then a large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of him. He became dehydrated. He became sad, hopless but still had energy to feel himself."
