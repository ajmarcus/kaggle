"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1 wanted to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building for refueling and services and to let passengers off and on. However, the builders of the Empire State Building went through many obstacles to allow this to happen. ""The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the @ORGANIZATION3 in Lakehurst, New Jersey"" (¦@NUM1). They had to meet with experts and analyze if that was going to be a successful idea. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it's purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed....the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (¦'s @NUM2 & @NUM3). Another obstacle that the builders had to deal with was nature. the winds up there were very strong, therefore the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was not successful."
