"In the memoir the mood that the author created is the memoir can be @CAPS1 in two ways. first was happy for being created and being able to use america's beautifulfriendlyness. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to a blood relative."" @CAPS2 was that knowing that if you have hope anything can be achived. ""I will never foreget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."
