"I think the mood of the story is being gratefull. I think this because in the story it says Narciso thank his parents for their love and sacrifice.Also because in the story, Narciso says that his parents turned a simple house into a home. Which means they were kind and selfless.And he says that ""the warmth of the kitchen of his humble house where a cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."
