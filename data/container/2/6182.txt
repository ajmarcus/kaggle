"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with a paragraph explaining when the character, Saeng will take her driving test again. She says she will ""when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."" I think the author concludes with this paragraph because it shows that saeng has new. found hope. For example, since she has moved from Vietnam, she has been very homesick. ""She found that she was still too shaky to say the words 'at home,' lest she burst into tears again."" But when she finds a hibiscus plant, it reminds her of her homeland. ""Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs."" Saeng even buys the hibiscus to plant in her garden in her new home. By having the hibiscus plant with her, it gave her memories of her old life and strength to continue with her new one. The plant gives her strength to try for her driving test again. By concluding with that paragraph, it shows Saeng's change in emotions from depressed to hopeful and it also shows the strength that the hibiscus plant gives her."
