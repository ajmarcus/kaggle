"While attempting to build a mooring dock on top of the Empire State building, the builders had some problems to overcome. The winds in New York City were too strong to fly a dirigible in, one driver said ""the captain could not take his hands off the control levers."" @CAPS1 so close to buildings in a dirigible was illegal for fear of crashing into ""sharp spires of other buildings in the area."" The only way to prevent the dirigible from swinging violently was to put large lead weights on it, but that would not be practical over New York. In conclusion, docking a drigible on the Empire State Building was too difficult and it never happened."
