"The setting affected the character in ways that would usually affect people. When he got into the first town he had ran out of water to drink but the towns water he was in now tasted like battery acid so thats not safe to drink. As he started to head out the scenery changed. Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This is hinting at the fact that maybe this town he is going to @MONTH1 be abandoned or not used. He saw a huge rattle snake and tumbleweed. Which are usual signs of a desert. It was hard for him to keep his balance as he says, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. He ended up getting to the point where he had to put rocks in his mouth to trick his mind that he wasnt thirsty anymore."
