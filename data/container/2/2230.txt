"The @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was a lot of work. They had to spend a whole lot of money and it wasn't a easy job. They spended over sixty thousand dollars on just modifications. I know this because in paragraph @NUM1 it said ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building frame work. @CAPS2 you can see they spended a lot of money on the mooring mast.Also it wasn't a easy job to make everything work there was a lot of things they had to worrie about like safety issues. I know it wasn't a easy job because in paragraph @NUM1 it also said ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State buildings flat roof."" @CAPS2 you can see they struggled to make the mooring mast accomplish."
