"In the story, “Winter Hibiscus”, the author ends with the last specified paragraph, “When they came back…then I will take that test again.” because it leaves many un-answered questions the reader might have. The reader then might want to read her next piece of work. Basically, the last paragraph drows attention to the reader. many of the unanswered questions revolve around, “I failed the test.”. We also do not know “her gentle grandmother”, “mrs.Lambert”, and “home”. Another reason the author might end the story with that paragraph is to have a effect on the reader. The reader is left to only assume and imagine what things are to come. Will she pass the test? Will she go home? What will happen? All we know is, ”when the snow melts, and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” most likely the author ended the story with the paragraph for dramatic effect for the reader. This is why, I believe the author of “Winter Hibiscus” ended with the specified paragraph."
