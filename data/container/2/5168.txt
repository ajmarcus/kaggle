"Hot, bumpy roads, no shade-all are things that affect the cyclist on his journey. He was riding in??? the and then the sun started beating down on him and he said it felt like the desert,” considering it was so hot. The road was fine at first and than he get a while down the had and it really started getting rough and hard to ride on. The part where he has no shade has to suck because he has the sun beating down on him all the time. All are reasons why the cyclist shouldn’t have taken directions in the first place."
