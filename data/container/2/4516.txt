"The cyclist had a hard trail to bike in order to get to @LOCATION1. It is easy to bike if you are on flat smoot terrain, when you get to rolling hills, it makes it a lot tougher. The biker said I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. It was also very hot. he was sweating and getting dehydrated, Id read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind of thirst. he had eighteen miles to next town without much water. The first deserted town didnt have any drinkable water. It was very hard to bike in these conditions, and is important to always be prepared and know were you are going."
