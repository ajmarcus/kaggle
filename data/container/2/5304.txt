"The features of the setting in this story make the ride more difficult for the cyclist. For example, the cyclist is moving through the  high   deserts of California    (kurmaskie @NUM1). This shows that the cyclist is at a high altitude, which makes breathing more difficult. Then the cyclist notes that the Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills    (Kurmaskie @NUM1   ). The hills would make the trip more difficult. This is evidenced by the cyclist describing one   of them as a    long, crippling hill  (Kurmaskie @NUM1 ). Clearly, the terrain, which got   increasingly difficult, negatively affected the cyclist."
