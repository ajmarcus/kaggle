"The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to give You an idea of how she feels about what happened to her. This paragraph is her telling herself that everything is ok and she going to do better next time. The author concluded the story with this paragraph to make Saeng sound more confident in herself. In the middle of the story when she was having the conversation with her mother, she sounded unconfident with herself so this paragraph made her sound like she was sure with herself, like she knew what she was going to do."
