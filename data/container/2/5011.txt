"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because someone travelling a good distance in California during June will be hot. If the cyclist doesnt have enough water to supply himself for if he gets lost then the features of the setting are very crucial. Not having enough water can cause someone to dehydrate, which does happen to the cyclist in the essay. I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. This statement proves that the cyclist wasnt a good state to be lost when the sun is blazing down on him. Also, when you are dehydrated and tired you @MONTH1 start to see things that arent there, but you want to see those things.  I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasnt a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. It was a good decision that the cyclist didnt get his hopes up about a building that might not be there overall, features of a setting for a cyclist can cause anything to happen, so be careful."
