"In the essay, the author added many features that could be picked all about the cyclist jouney. One feature was that his water supply was running short. This shows exactly how hot it was and how much he was drinking. Another feature would be the rusty old pipe with the bad water: This shows that that town had been abanodoned for years and the water supply wasnt up for drinking. The essay in all shows how hand it is in hot weather with lack of supplies and no sense of direction."
