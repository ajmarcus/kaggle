"The cyclist is affected by the change in terrain from flat to hilly, the elderly mens directions and most importantly his thirst. He tries to save what little water he has left for time when he really needs it. He looks for a place to cool off and get water, which he finally does in the end. Hes also a little bit angry and disappointed of the old mens directions. Hes really going a lot more miles then he should be according to the directionsand he's beginning to wonder if theyve lost it.
