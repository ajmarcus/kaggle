"In the essay Do Not Exceed Speed Limit, the features of the setting affected the cyclist in a few ways. One way it affected him was that the temperature was very hot and by it being hot outside his water wouldnt stay cool. This is a problem because you need nice, cool, refreashing water to stay hydrated. Another way was when he hit a fork in the road. He didnt know which way to go. All he saw was one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnt hold the lamest mule greeted me. The sight was troubling. Last but not least this water pump wasnt working very well so he got down on his hands and knees and started pumping. The water wouldnt cool down. He tried a drop or two and the water tasted like battery acid. Those are some features of the setting that affected the cyclist on his journey."
