"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. An example would be from the excerpt when the author writes in paragraph 6 ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of suitable landing area."" This quote means the builders were faced with the challenge of space to land the dirigibles because New York City was a relatively crowded area. Another example would be in paragraph @NUM1, when the author tells about the safety hazards. Many dirigibles used hydrogen insted of helium, which is extremely flammable. A last example would be in paragraph @NUM2 when the author describes the safety hazards. The builders had to consider the violent winds on the top of the building. Many obstacles came upon the builders."
