"In Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" the cyclist is affected alot by his surroundings. He is leaving the old water pump for Yosemite. Not two miles flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. The speed limit was 55. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM1. This shows that as the terrain gets rougher and harder, how much harder it is for the cyclist to go on. Also, since he is already getting to the point at which he is getting dehydrated, it is that much harder for the already tired cyclist to go on any further more less make it all the way to Yosemite. That is how the terrain affects the cyclist.  "
