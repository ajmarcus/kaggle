"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: the blueprints of Our Lives,"" the author creats a special mood. I think the mood is kind of both happy and sad at the same time. It is sad because the parents had to leave all of their family, friends, and careers back in Cuba, while coming to @LOCATION1 not Knowing the language. He didn't even get to meet his real grand parents until 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba. The mood is happy too because the parents did all of this for their child. He gets to live a happy life in their new home, with their new friends."
