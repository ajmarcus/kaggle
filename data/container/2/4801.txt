"The setting in the short story Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie is troubling to the cyclist One ramshackleshed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnt hold in the tamest mule greeted me, made him troubled that he was in the middle of nowhere. The quote, Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing, flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills, shows that he was troubled by having to go over the hills. As you can see the setting was very influental to the cyclist."
