"In the story Winter Hibiscus"" I believe they end the story the way they did, when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again because with saeng making a goal, shes overcoming her disappointment and uncomfort living in a new country. The archetyple meaning of a flower bud is: prosper, new, growth. This shows he growing and thats important in life and thats why the ended it the way they did. Its a positive ending."
