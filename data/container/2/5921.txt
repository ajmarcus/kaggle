"The author concludes this story this way to go over again the important things in the story. ÒI will  take that test again,Ó This is the test that she had failed that day. The test that she failed tested her memory of her home. Her old country was so important to her. The part in the quote,Ó when they come back.... when the show me it and the geese return,Ó is referring to when she says,Ó She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become É almost familiar to her. Like the geese,Ó She is saying that everything in this country she is starting to get used to like the geese that fly south every winter.Ó When she uses ""and this hibiscus is budding,"" she is saying how she will remember all the things she has forgotten when she moved over here to this country.Ó When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center Ðjust as she had known it would feel. This whole statement is basically saying  that she is starting to forget things in her country as this country becomes more familiar but when the geese return meaning in the @DATE1 then she will remember again and she will take that test again of her knowledge and pass."
