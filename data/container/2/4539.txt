"In the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects him negatively because he was on his bicycle and he was in a hot area and no water whatsoever, like  in this quote, “I  got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substance ozzed out.” In the quote, the cyclist finally thinks he has found a water pump but he really gets nothing. Also, another negative thing is that he thought he was never going  to get to where he was going, but in the end , he got there and he got some water."
