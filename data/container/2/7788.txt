"The mood in the memoir is happyness, and friendship, and glory, an example is ""My parents always always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. A feeling of friendship and honesty is ""it was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, where clearly in need."" and that is the mood of the memoir."
