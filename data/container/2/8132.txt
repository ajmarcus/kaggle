"The mood of this story was a happy and a reflective one. Many times during the story, especially in paragraph @NUM1, he told us what his parents did, but also after almost every sentence in parentheses he would say how much it meain to him. For example, he says how his parents cooked, and after that: (and for which I am eternally grateful). This shows how much he loved his parents for passing on their culinary skillsIn one paragraph, he starts off the sentence with: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This again shows the mood of greatfullness, happiness, and reflectiveness from the story."
