"I believe the author concludes the story like this to show an example of perserverance. Saeng states, Òthrough the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" This statement represents adjusting to change. Soon she will adjust fully to her new home, it just takes time. If she keeps perservering. she will make it. In the last paragraph Saeng says, Òwhen the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" Just as the season's bring things back, she will come back. I believe this last paragraph was put in to show everyone should perservere because things just take time."
