"The dirigibles were not able to dock on the mast of the Empire State Building for obvious reasons. When the construction workers were building the mast, they didn't realize how dangerous it was having a dirigible landing on the top of the building. There were a few cautions that the workers realized. First off, if the dirigible catches on fire like the one in Lakehurst, New Jersey, then a lot of people would be at risk because it is such a big city with massive amounts of people. Another reason they realized after was that it was too dangerous for the dirigible to land there due to the high swirling winds. If they tried landing there, but the violent winds wouldn't let them, then it would not be the least bit safe. This is how the workers of the Empire State building faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there."
