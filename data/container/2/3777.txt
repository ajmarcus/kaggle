"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the short story ÒDo not exceed posted speed limit.Ó The cyclist mood seems to change as the road and setting does. The narration states, Ò a large high way sign jumped out at me. I read : Rough road ahead : Do not exceed posted speed limit É sometimes life can feel so cruel (Kurmaskie). Slowly as the terrain gets harder and harder the cyclist feels worse and worse. Every time he believes there is a town he gets happy but his dreams are soon crushed. One can see in the picture the hard cycling terrain that can affect the cyclist making him tired due to lack of water and sense of hopelessness he feels as he loses energy and believes he will die."
