"The mood created by the author in the memoir is joyfull. The author tells us how he loves his cuban culture. They listen to the music, the cook food and it's just very house warming. The author also loves his family. He doesn't argue with them and they enjoy the time they have together. I think the author is joyfull with all the happiness that surrounds him at his house."
