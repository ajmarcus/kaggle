"In the story, the cyclist starts out with a lot of confidence that he can complete the whole ride. But after he left first town he had been riding and needed water, so he stoped at a fork in the road he had just to;to get water from a pump which tastes like battery acid. Then as he progressed further in his trip he came to a sign that said Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed speed limit(Joe Kurmaskie pg @NUM1) This part of his trip made it very challenging by making him face rough roads and mountains that he had to cross which sucked the water out of him. Then as  he came over the last mountain, he saw a sign for a gart store. So when he arrived he got some water and got directions for a man who had the best map. So you can see that going over an the mountains, sucks all the water out of the cyclist, so he was so relieved when he got the water at the end."
