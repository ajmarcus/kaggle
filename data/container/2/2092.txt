"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. in the excerpt ""The Mooring Mask"" by @PERSON1. The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building were all very competitive for the Building to be very tall and they did not have a very great plan that they used. They wanted the building to have a great top and wanted it to also be useful, so they wanted dirigibles to dock there They figured out after that it wasn't such a good idea when they looked into the history of how many accidents happened. If any accident happened in New York like that then it would be a very big deal because there are so many people that live there. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mask. They felt it would be unsafe for many reasons. This is the reason why the builders went through many obstacles"
