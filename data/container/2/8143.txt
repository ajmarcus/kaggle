"The mood in the memoir is very uplifting. The story is mostly about how much the author appreciates his family and what his parents have done for him. It also shows how happy the family was and how everyone around them were family iregardless of where they immigrated from. In paragraph @NUM1 he says ""Family had nothing to do with being a blood relative""."
