"The mood of the memoir is happy and thankful. The author explains how his parents brought him to the United States. All of his neighbors were spanish, cuban or Italian. They were all friends and had a good bond. He had people at his house for dinners. It was here in the United States, that he really understood what family was or what a home was. He couldn't show his parents how grateful he was for them to go through such a hard time to make their childrens lives better. The thankful mood he displays makes the story more meaningful."
