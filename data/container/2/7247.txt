I think the author's mood was kind of like @CAPS1. I said that because as he was going along in the memoir at the end this statement is that his mom and dad turn a simple house into a home. That statement tells me that the author feels @CAPS1 well he is inside his home or inside a home with his family members. I Also say that the author feels grateful because the great culture and heritage he has came from.
