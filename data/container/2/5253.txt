The features of the setting effect the cyclist because it is to hot. It is hot enough that his water tasts like battery acid.  Then he has to deal with difficult trails breakway he said “old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” This is sayin that the old-timers gave him old directions. Plus what made the setting even hotter was he has been cycling nonstop. Then when he was riding he said “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over it.” With him thinking about this it made him forget about the heat. This was why the setting was affecting the cyclist.
