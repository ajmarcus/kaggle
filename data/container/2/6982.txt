"The author concludes the story with this piece because she said “a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear,” I think she means that even tho the geese flew over with their heads up high even tho Saeng’s wasn’t. “Next year when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She means she will not have her head down and be grateful of her new home and it with time. She looks at her hibiscus she will have found memories but not be sad."
