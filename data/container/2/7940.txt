"In the memoir, the author creates a mood of love and community. In paragraph two the author describes his childhood home with words like traditional, passionate, and congregation. These words set the tone for the rest of the memoir in which love in helping the community are key themes. It gives me the feeling that I could walk into their home and be welcomed with open arms even as a complete stranger. These themes are reinforced in the last few sentences when the author ends speaking about his gracious neighborhood and how he learned to love."
