"The mood created by the memoir is greatfulness. I think this because this is one of the words he uses over and over again to show emphasis. Narciso says ""... And for which I am eternally grateful. (paragraph @NUM1). In paragraph @NUM2 he also says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso's memoir states all the things he is grateful for this is why I believe greatfulness is the mood of this passage"
