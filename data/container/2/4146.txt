"The setting can affect a cyclist in a lot of ways. One way setting affects cyclist is when it is hot, it is harder to cycle long distances. I say this because in the story the narrator says and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke @CAPS1 part of setting that affects cyclist is the terrain they cycle on. For example it is much easy to cycle on flat smooth ground than it is on the rolling hills with rough, rocky ground. This is shown with the quote ride down into distances I could see over the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, Id be fine. Setting can have a great deal of affect on a cyclist, depending on if its smooth or rocky, or hot or cool. "
