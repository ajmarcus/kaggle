"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from @CAPS1: The Blueprints of Our Lives The mood created by the author in the memoir is very cultural and family. The mood is very cultural because they created the home into a cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. The Parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly Passed their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking. The mood is also family because when someone needed a place to stay from their family they would let them stay at their house."
