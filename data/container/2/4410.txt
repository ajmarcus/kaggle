"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example when the author says flat roads were replace by short rolling hills, that made the author have to ride safer. Also, when he says, the ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement. The author had to slow down on his bike and find a safe way around it so he could get past. Finally when the author says no one in sight, no building, car, or structure, he is affected because he cant ask questions since hes lost and hes thirsty. The setting makes it hard for the author to maneuver and get to where he wants to go."
