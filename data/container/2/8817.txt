"The mood Created by the author is @CAPS1. I @CAPS5 this because you can tell that the narrator doesn't take anything for granted. I know this because the @CAPS2 parents was given a house, and since @CAPS8 was part of the family, it was her duty to make that house a home as much as possible with her parents. I Know this because it @CAPS7 it in @CAPS3 @NUM1, and @NUM2.The author also gives a @CAPS4 mood in this memoir. I @CAPS5 this because in @CAPS3 @NUM1, and @NUM4 it @CAPS7 that @CAPS8 is Cuban and italian, from Newark, New Jersey, and @CAPS8 seems to be @CAPS4 of who @CAPS8 is and where @CAPS12 from. I know all of this is true because its all in the text."
