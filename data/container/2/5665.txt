"In the story “winter hibiscus “by @CAPS1 Ho the storey ends with Saeng promising herself that she will take the test again in the spring. The author most likely ends this way because it shows how Saeng is getting over her sorrow test in the spring when the Hibiscus is in @LOCATION1. This is shown when Saeng says “I-I failed the test (@NUM1) this shows @CAPS2 leaving her homeland and makes her even more so sad, but she then promises herself that in the spring when flowers @LOCATION1 she will try again. She does this when she says to herself “…in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.”(pg @NUM2) this shows her getting over her sorrow and becoming determined and looking forward and taking the test again."
