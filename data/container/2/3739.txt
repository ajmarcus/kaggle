"Many features in the setting affect the cyclist. Several main features include the cars lading town. that aint really towns anymore, and the water pump. Both of these examples gave him hope but none gave him relief. The town he first saw could give him water, but it was all run down and weakened. “I arrived at the first “town”. This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time... refer the @NUM1 word war.” He is saying that the town could’ve given him more water and enery, but it appeared that it was over for this town. Additionally, he biked across a water pump that was well needed He tried to pump water but got no success. “I pumped the handle for several minutes but the water wouldn’t cool down.” A working water pump would’ve been huge for him giving him more strength to bike. However, once again it was very misleading"
