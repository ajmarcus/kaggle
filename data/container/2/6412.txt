"The author concludes the story with this paragraph, because it expresses the meaning of the story. Life continues no matter what, the hibiscus will return again in the spring. The hibiscus is like a symbol to Saeng's life. The plant normally doesn't survive in winter months, but this one did. The mother says, ""It's flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the winter months here..."" Saeng and her mother are just like the plant. They are strong and their lives will continue even though they are in a  new environment The author chose to end the story with that parragraph because even  though she say the hibiscus will come back every spring the deeper meaning is that Saeng and her mother, like the hibiscus, will continue to live their lives."
