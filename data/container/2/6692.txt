"I believe the author ended the story with that paragraph to create a sense of wonder. I think this because if you put into context the word test, it could mean many things. For example it could mean the test to overcome the sadness of her situation. Also it could mean the test to adjust to her new home when the spring comes. That is why I think the author tried to create a sense of wonder with the final paragraph."
