"In the story Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the author concluded the story with an interesting paragraph. It was, When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again (@NUM1). This shows that the girl is adapting to her new country and hopes to do better in the spring. The reson the author ended the story with this paragraph is because it shows that the girl has successfully adapted to her new country and is determined to get stronger as time goes. She is saying when the hibiscus returns, she will be ready to take the test again and not fail it."
