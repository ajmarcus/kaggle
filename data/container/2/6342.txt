"I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because new beginnings.What I mean by this is,the hibiscus represents new beginnings.She says “When the hibiscus is budding ,then I will take the test again “.This will be a new start for her  .The plant  blooming makes her happy and reminds her of her grandmother.She’s saying by the time the spring comes around she  would be ready for a  new obstacle as so for the hibiscus plant."
