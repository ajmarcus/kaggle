"In the memoir the author gives off a happy and greatful mood. He talks not have they changed their home into a tradition Cuban home, the hearth of which is the kitchen. Narciso says he is eternally greatful for the skill of cooking his parents gave him. They had ""family"" over all the time, and they would even let people stay over till they got back on their feet. He was greatful for them doing everything they could so their kids could have a greater life. They had also taught him the real definition of ""Family"" and he is greatful to them for ever more."
