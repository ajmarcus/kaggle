"The mood created by the authour in the memoir, is the idea of sacrifice and generosity. @PERSON1's parents came to @LOCATION1 as immigrants from Cuba and by doing this took a very risky and difficult journey in order to make @PERSON1 have a more successful life. The parents gave up seeing their families, friends and careers in the country they loved. Narciso displays generosity by saying ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."
