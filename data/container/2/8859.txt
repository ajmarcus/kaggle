"The mood created by the author in this memoir is the appreciation through the author's parents. Another mood is the happiness of ""home"" or family. In paragraph @NUM1, the author is grateful to her parents for their love and sacrifice and courage. In the last paragraph, paragraph @NUM2, Narciso mentions how welcomed refugees that just arrived to the country were at their house to stay, that the ""warmth of this Kitchen and humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with life and love"" made her learn the definition of ""family""."
