"The mood of this memoir is suppost to be @CAPS1 and thoughfull or happy feelings. The author is talking about his past, when he was younger. He loves his past life when he was little because it was full of happyness and good times with his family. you @CAPS2't need to be blood related to be family. All these good people got together and became family. And with this family came the good times. Makeing the mood happy. never being able to thank your Parents enough for giving you that chance to live a happy life is also part of the mood. Thankfulness."
