"In the memoir there is more the one mood, but this is the main one. First, the author is trying to create a ""no place like home mood,"" and the author succeeds at it. It seems he/she is using memory and telling his/her background. The mood was also very calm and very relaxing for the story. In conclusion this is the mood the author is giving."
