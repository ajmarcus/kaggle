The builders of the Empire State building faced many challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was that putting the mast on the empire state building then having a giant dirigible moor on to it would cause stress on the building and could pull the mast right off causing it to weigh the dirigible down to the people and buildings it could cause death and destruction. Another obstacle was timing the construction right. They dont want the mast to be done when the whole building is only on floor @NUM1 out of 102.
