"The mood is obvesoly love, and greatfulness. ""(And for which I am exernally greatful)."" The boy is young so he doesn't quite get how big that move for them was. ""In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely."" This means leaving family, friends, @CAPS1 new jobs, a house to put over his head, and leaving their home to give a great one for their son. He is thankful that his parents were still able to keep his cuban life alive. They didn't forget where they came from.Now I think about it one of his moods could be sad because he was the reason for all that happend. What happen if he was never born he would ever never found out what family means. That is why in this memoir has some greatfulness, some love, and that little bit of sadness."
