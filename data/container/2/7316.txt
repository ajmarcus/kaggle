"The mood created in this memoir is very homebound. How the parents turned the ""simple house"" into the ""traditional Cuban home"" was shocking. The parents played the ""Passionate Cuban music."" and ""a love of cooking"" helped create a family mood, and it showed how much they love their heritage. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relitave. This family loved spending time w/ eachother, and celebrating. Over all, the mood is loving, happy, and caring."
