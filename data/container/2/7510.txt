These imagrents do not have a lot to work with. They live in small homes that are durty but in a suprizing way the manage. All these imagrents from different cultures that live in the same neiborhood came together in great soldarity and frendship. There are other imigrents that are unlucky and don't find jobs or houses, they have to eather leave or stay tempory with other people until they get back on their feet. In conclusion in this memoir the author created a very sad mood as you can see from the some of the spesific deatils from the story I have included."
