"The @CAPS1 created by the author in the memoir is understanding & love, because no matter where you are, you can always bring a piece of where your from and place it where you are at present. For example his parents decorated the Kitchen in cuban ways and listened to cubin music. Keeping their hintage going. And he realizes how great and hardworking his parents are, how good they've been to him. Also even if your not blood related, when loved ones come altogether, who care about eachother, thats family."
