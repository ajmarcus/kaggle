"In the story Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the setting of the story majorly affected the cyclist. The story tells us I was travelling through the high deserts of California  in June. The extreme heat of the summer definitely put a  strain on the cyclist causing him to have to drink lots of water . Unfortonatly the  towns were very far apart and many not having good water making dehydration  problem. There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or a structure of any kind. @CAPS1 of this would have happened had he been cycling at a marathon with people handing him water when requested, or if he had been smart enough to follow a good map."
