"The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is happy, grateful, and loving. The @CAPS1 shares her background life with us. She expresses to us how she feels about her Passionate Cuban music, and her parents great cooking skills. ""A love of cooking that is still with me to."" ""Passionate Cuban Music (which I adore to this day filled the air."" This shows that atl this time the @CAPS1 is grateful about her cooking and music. The @CAPS1 shows her self as a really grateful for all her parents have done for him. ""I thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for this spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age"". The @CAPS1 mood is so warming when she expresses her love for the parents, music, and cooking skills. The @CAPS1 creates many moods throught the memoir, but I think mostly she thankful for her family and heritage."
