"In the excerpt @ORGANIZATION2, written by @ORGANIZATION1, The builders of the empire State building face obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock There, ""one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of suitable landing areas."" (paragraph 6). If the Dirigibles can't lead it could cause destruction and could be very dangerous to people. In paragraph @NUM1 Al Smith says, It's on level all right no kidding wer'e working on the thing right now."" This shows the readers that the way he words things sounds almost unreliable. When constructing the idea of Dirigibles a mooring mast had to be added to the top of the building to allow passengers on and off. However This idea was unsafe. ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using Empire State building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on street was neither practical nor safe."" (paragraph @NUM2). This unsafe why would the build something harmful to others. In the excerpt The Mooring Mast written by @ORGANIZATION1. The builders have a hard time constructing the dirigibles."
