"The mood of the memoir is pleasent. @PERSON1 talks about her nice childhood. She talks about selfless her parents are to her. Also the mood is set when @PERSON1's is parents help other people get back on their feet. Also talking about how people would eat dinner with @PERSON1's family. She also tells about how she had family that weren't exactly blood relatives but, they were people who cared for each other like a family. Also the way Narciso told was with a very pleasant tone."
