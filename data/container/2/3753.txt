The features of the setting affect the cycleist in many diferent ways. For example it was June and he was in the @CAPS1 of California. It was very hot and the dehydrated him. Also he did no know where he was going so he had to rely on other people directions. Also he had to keep dehydrate. That what affected the cycleist.
