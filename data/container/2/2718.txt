"The builders of the Empire State building face a couple challenges in trying to build a dock for dirigibles on it. One main problem was that it was clearly unsafe because dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and they didn't want to have another accident like the Hindenburg. They realized that if an accident like that had happened in a densely populated area such as New York, it would have been a thousand times worse."
