"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @ORGANIZATION2 the architects faced many reasons in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects couldn't put a mooring mast at first because it will add stress to the buildings frame. The architects had to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the building to accomplish the new situation they are doing. Before putting the mooring mast the architects designed a shiny glass, chrome-nickel stainless steel tower to have the overall shape of the building. Even before constructing the mooring mast on top of the building the roof had to be completed. when putting the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building; it didn't work out. When they tested it the dirigible didn't get close enough to tie it up. So in the future ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2 did not work out."
