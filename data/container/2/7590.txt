"@PERSON1 wrote this memoir in a happy, warm, senseful way. He was able to describe in great detail what went on in his house during his childhood and how caring and loving his parents were. Not just to him but to almost anybody. Anyone that was considered family was allowed in and he was also grateful to be Cuban and for the foods he was able to eat and the beautiful aromas in his Cuban kitchen. His description of this home is very soothing to me because it just has a happy background and his talk so highly of. It is a tempting place to attend life in this make the best of"" little Cuban home."""
