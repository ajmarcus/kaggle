"I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng won’t give up & will keep trying. In the story all the memories of her old country encouraged her to be strong. For example the flower made her sad but in the end it made her better. Also in the beginning she didn’t really like new changes and she missed home, but at the end some of the same memories she had back home were in her new country. Those are the reasons I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph"
