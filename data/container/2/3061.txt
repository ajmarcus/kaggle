"Based on the exerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is as follows. The first challenge was to find ""a practical, workable arrangement"" for the engineers to be able to work well and safely. Another problem the builders faced was how to put a ""thousand-foot dirigible moored"" into a building that was 1,046 feet tall. The main obsticle they faced was the fact that the dirigible moored ""would add stress to the building's frame"" which may cause it to fall due to its weight. For the builders to overcome the challenge, they would have to modify and give more strength to the ""steel frame of the Empire State Building."" @CAPS1, the builders went through a lot of obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building, but in the end it was all worth their hard work to make Al Smith keep his winning title."
