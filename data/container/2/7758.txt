"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" written by ""Narciso Rodriguez, @CAPS1 designer"", the moods created by the author in the memoir are mainly happiness, gratefullness, and being humble. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 Narciso mentions alittle bit about his past, and how gratefull he is for what he has today. Narciso knows that his parents try their best to give him a better life. He knew that the move would have to be a big sacrifice for his parents to do so he thanks them often. No matter  were Narciso was, either a good place or a bad place, he always found happiness. This @CAPS2 doesn't have alot of different moods but few simaler ones. The @NUM1 moods that were mainly presented in the @CAPS2 are happiness and gratefull and all of which came from Narciso Rodriguez."
