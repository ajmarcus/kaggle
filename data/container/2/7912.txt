"Narciso Rodriguez's @CAPS1 from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, creates a very optimistic mood.Narciso describes how even though ""at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States"", he and his ""family"" (which included foreign neighbors) still overcame adversity. In addition he describes how even though his neighborhood shared different cultural backgrounds, they still lived together as a family. Lastly he describes all the memories and celebrations that helped shape his house from a living space into place of love and friendship. It is real easy to tell that Narciso loved his family and friends all the same in a way that shaped his life."
