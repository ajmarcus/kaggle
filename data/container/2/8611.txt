"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood is gratefulness. Mood means the overall atmosphere of the authors words. I think that it is happyness, because no matter what happens, Rodriguez is always gratfull. She does not care if she lives in a simple house with a bunch of people, she is happy that she has a home. In paragraph @NUM1, she says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" I would have looked up to her, for being this gratfull and happy for what she has. Also, the last sentence she says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" These are a perfect example of the mood, greatfullness, and some of happyness."
