"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the rougher the terrain got the more the cyclist had to strain to make it. For example, when the terrain turned to hills, the cyclist had to struggle to climb the hills which caused him to use more of his energy. Also, if the terrain was flat and smooth, the cyclist had less problems making the long journey. For instance, if the cyclist had less strain on him then he would not be as tired and would not drink as much water. In conclusion, that is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist."
