The mood from my perspective would be a calm and cozy sentimental feeling. When the author would talk about how his parents passed so many feelings and so much culture it made me think about who I am and where I am from. It gave me a warm and fuzzy feeling about the cooking and music and family and I can relate to that. It gave me a feeling of perseverance and to not stop striving for what you believe in.  It made me feel strong and inspired my the mother and father's dedication to family.
