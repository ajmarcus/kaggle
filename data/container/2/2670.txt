"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, alot of problems were faced in allowing the dirigibles to dock there. The obstacles that were faced would put peoples safety at risk. One of the problems was the tail of the dirigibles would swirvle because of how high up it was the wind would be violent. Another problem that was stated in paragraph @NUM1 was forgeign dirigibles were made with hydrogen instead of helium so they were flamable."
