"The features of the land around the cyclist caused him to confront  nature. when he began his trip with advice from “old coggers” he “ rode out with strong legs and a smile.” As he came to the first town, he describes it as a “ghost town” having no water and no human contact for some time. This should have been his cue to stop and turn around in hopes of another route to Yosemite. But with strong determination, he rods on. Through the miles he incountered a ramshackie shed, rusty pumps, snakes,and the wicked terrain. The short rolling hills tested his “inner spirit” and caused his dehydration to further. The land around the cyclist not only victimized his heath but also caused a poor way to spend a vacation."
