"In many ways, the setting affected his journey to Yosemite. If the setting wouldn't have been so bad, the long ride wouldnt have been as hard on his body. Since the setting was a very hot day in June, in a California desert, when he did find a well he said,  followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.  @CAPS1 thing about the setting is, if it wouldnt have been so hot, he wouldnt have needed as much water. And, if he would have gotten the water he needed because it was so hot, it wouldn't have been so physically draining on his body. I know it was physically draining because he said   I  could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.  In conclusion, the setting played a major role in the story."
