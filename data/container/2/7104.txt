"The mood created by the author of the memoir is cozy and family oriented. From the very beginning, the author describes the home as more of a way of life than a physical space. The author's ""parents created our traditional Cuban home, part of which was the kitchen"" (@NUM1). Here, the home is described even more as a part of the family, less is a building.     To enhance the feeling of family, the author includes stories of hospitality: ""My parents always kept their arms and their door to the many people he considered family"" (@NUM2). Hospitality is one of the best qualities you need to make a house a home and the author really stretches that. The mood created by the author of the memoir is cozy and family oriented."
