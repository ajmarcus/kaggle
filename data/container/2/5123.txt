"Excitement, desperation, and self-pitty are all feelings the cyclist had because of the setting. He was really excited to get to Yosemite park because of it peacefulness. He said, Òthe cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite are calling my name.Ó He wanted to get their because it was so hot. He started getting desperate for water, so he drank out of this hot water hole. ÒI tried a drop or two, tasted like battery acid.Ó He was running out of water so he got desperate for some. He started to have self-pitty on his self,Ó sometimes life can be so cruel,Ó he was feeling pitty on himself because he had such a long way to go still. These are all feeling the cyclist had because of the setting."
