"The mood in the memoir is happy. It is happy because it is a talking about Narciso's memories. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The mood is also appreciative. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, it says ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" The mood is also sad. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, it says ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. So there was several moods in this memoir."
