"The obstacles of the builders of the Empire State Building faced were hard because they couldn't just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building do to the frame work Also the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. Which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would also have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. And over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications have to be made to the building's framework The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from sides, with a steps-back design that imitated over all shape of the building itself capital rocket-shape mast would have four wings at its corners, of shiny-aluminum, and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm."
