"The author used ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again because its resembling that her mother is refreshing, waking, and restoring its self. And Saeng said she would retake the driving test when that happens. She was really sad she failed. I  I failed the test She seemed to be embarrassed + sad. So that last paragraph does a good job describing what Saeng is going to do. She is going to look on the bright side of things and restore her self to come back and pass the test"
