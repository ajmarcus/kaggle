"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the mood is kind of happy, sad and is greatful. Narciso is very happy because he usually gets to spend time with ""family"" and is also very happy that his family hes with him and that more family will come from cuba in a few years. He is sad because he cant see his grandfather and because his parents didn't get to live such a great life as him. He is greatful for being alive for his parents doing everything for him bringing him to @LOCATION1 and he's greatful because he got to live such a great life because of his parents. That was the mood of the memoir."
