"many obstacles were taken while trying to get the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock there. This was a long, hard and thought out process. Workers couldn't just drop a mooring mast on top of the building's roof. A one thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building. It was being held by a single cable tether, which added stress to the buildings frame. The architects also had to build a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building. Later on they realized dirigibles could not moor a the Empire State building. One reason being a law against airships flying to low over urban areas. Architects went through many obstacles in building masts. "
