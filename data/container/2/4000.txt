"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many way. Having desert rahas makes you want to just lay their and not try to go any further, because you don’t know where and end will be. As for grassy, flowery land its more of a sense rout, and makes you want to keep going and see many things. Hills and terrain make it harder to keep going but more of a chalange, and a good workout at the same time, the setting does affect the cyclist."
