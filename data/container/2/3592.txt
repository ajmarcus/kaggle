"The essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” describes a man’s bicycle ride through California. Now, California is very hot during the summer, which is when the cyclist is riding. This setting greatly affects the man’s journey. It made it very difficult for him to finish his ride. He drank most of his water in the beginning of his ride so he gets very dehydrated. The text states, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” As you can see the setting makes this man’s bikeride very hard."
