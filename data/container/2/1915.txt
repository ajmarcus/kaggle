"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was that a thousand- foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable, would add stress to the buildings frame. So in order to strengthen the frame it would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another challenge was the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure. The last obstacle was safety because of an accident took place in downtown New York it would be devastating."
