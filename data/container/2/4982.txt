"Being a cyclist is not as easy as it sounds. Sure riding a bike might be easy, but being a cyclist is so much more difficult. Cyclist have many obsticles to over come while riding. One obstacle would be a rough terrain. Cyclist are used to riding on smooth, paved roads. Going off – road or riding on a dirt road might be a challenge. In the short story “Do Exceed posted Speed Limit”, by Joe Kurmaskie also has another example for an obsticle cyclist have to be careful of, and that is running out of water, “I eased past, trying to keep by balance in my dehydrated state” (@CAPS1 @NUM1). The cyclist went on in telling how he needed to try to keep his balance but it was hard because he was dehydrated, and balancing is important when riding a bike. In conclusion when it comes to as easy as riding a bike, you need to take precaution in what might lie ahead."
