"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles well attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the ""violent air-currents."" Due to these currents, it became very hard to be able to allow a dirigible to dock at the top of the empire state building, without blowing away. Another obstacle was safety. The dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, instead of helium. Hydrogen is a very flammable object and if an accident were to happen, a flaming balloon flying over a highly populated area of New York could become very dangerous. Although the idea of making docking stations for dirigibles is a good idea, there are too many obstacles and hazards preventing it from ever happening."
