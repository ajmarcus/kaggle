"In this memoir by @PERSON1, he explains and recalls the home he grew up in. He talks about the small little @NUM1 room house and explains how his parents made it home like. The mood Rodriguez created is sort of reminisant/wistful mood of his days as a kid in the house. He talks about, how his parents ""... both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me there are rich culinary skills and love of cooking..."" (@NUM2 2.@NUM1-5). This sort of sets up the mood of the narrator being reminisant and grateful of his life as a kid."
