"In the memoir, the author definatly creates a mood that you can obviously see. He creates a mood of friendship in pharagraph @NUM1, ""our land lord and his daughter (my baby sitter and first friend), lived a bove us and graced our kitchen tables for meals more often than not."" Also a feeling of love in pharagraph @NUM1 (again), ""there was often somone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" The final mood he sets is a feeling of gratefulness in pharagraph @NUM3, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"". Therefore, the overall mood is his appriciation for his family."
