"In the story the author concludes the story the way she did because it is metaphoric, I say this because she is comporing herself to the hibiscus plant. As a hibiscus would be tested to over come conditions such as the cold and forexample in the test the author states “ its flowers arent as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here. This winter hibiscus”. She as the hibiscus will bloom again and have to pass the test of surviving the cold, will be able to have a chance to pass her own test, that is why the author concludes the story as she did."
