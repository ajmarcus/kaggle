"In the story Winter Hibiscus by @CAPS1 Ho. The author is stating that Saeng is happy when she is around the plant and she finds peace with the plant because it brings back childhood memories. For example And that rich sweet scent, that was familiar ton. She loved the way it made her feel. When one of the leaves fell off and she breathed in, it remined her of grandmother. @CAPS1 might of experienced something like this. @CAPS1 might of wrote this because the story could relate to other people who moved from another country and have something that brought back memories. Everytime that l touch or smell a sweater,it brings back memorises of my grandmother. I feel that he wrote this because of his personal experience and it could relate to others"
