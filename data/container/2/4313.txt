"In the story the author says, ÒThe sun was beginning to beat down trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state,Ó This gives you the idea that the heat is getting to him and is steadily depleting his water supply. At ore point he almost gives him self up to despair and dies of dehydration. It seems that he will never reach his good and he will continue to suffer in the grueling heat. I could almost feel the sweat and heat that the cyclist was feeling. Also, I could almost feel the lump in my throat when he says, Òwith any luck IÕd hit a bump and lodge a pebble in my throat.Ó The heat definitely effects this mans cycling in a bad way. He was exhausted and could not go on without water."
