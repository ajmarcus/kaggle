"The architects had their hands full when building the addition to the Empire State Building. There were @CAPS1 obstacles that needed to be overcome when they started building such as making sure the dirigibles were safe enough also taking in consideration the winds that are constantly changing. These problems were part of why the plans were put to a hault.Certain weather conditions were a big part of the safety procedures that took place. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The winds would make the ship sway back and forth which would be extremely dangerous. Another problem was that @CAPS1 foreign ships ran on hydrogen which is flamable and that would be a high risk. ""@CAPS1 dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable."
