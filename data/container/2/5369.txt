"I believe that the author concludes the story like this to show a sense of continuation in life. In the story Saeng takes a “test” and fails. She goes out and buys a hibiscus plant for well over what she what she should have paid for it. Her test is to try to get over the memories of her real “home” that Saeng is now only cries about when she thinks of it. To Saeng the plant represents memories and a life that she once had, but no longer does, however does want it back. Her vowe to herself is that when the geese come flying back over her that she will go back to the greenhouse that reminds her so much of her home and try once again to say “home” without breaking down, and without having something extremely expensive."
