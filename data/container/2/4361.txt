"The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist in this story. First, when he got to the road sign that said “Rough Road Ahead” he was already low on water, but that made things much worse. The rough road made it harder for him to pedal; therefore, he was working harder and getting thirsty. Also, when he stopped at the old Welch’s Grape Juice Factory, he noticed some pebbles on the ground and shoved them in his mouth. “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing spit you have left to circulate”. Lastly, “GARY AND WILBER’S FISH CAMP”, could possibly have saved the cyclist’s life. He stopped there and finally got a well deserved drink of water to settle his dehydration and fear. The setting and features severly affected the cyclist throughout his journey.  "
