"The terrain the cyclist faces dont help very mach considering he is almost out of water, he came across hills that ticed himout a lot & made him even more thirsty. Also, when we came across the juice factory he used a lot of energy to get there because he was excited and that made him even more thirsty. Therefore if he didnt have any energy left after all of that he wouldnt have been able to get to the baits shop."
