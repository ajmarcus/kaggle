"The author most likely concludes the story that way because that is the time that Saeng feels most comfortable. Saeng and her mom moved from Vietnam, were the winter Hibiscus are popular and familiar to Saeng. She ends the text in this maner because it remins Saeng about Vietnam, and how she feels better during that time of year. When she says ÒAnd beside it was yet another old friend.Ó She feels as if this plant is a friend to her and it makes her feel more comfortable. This is why the author ended the story in the manner that she did."
