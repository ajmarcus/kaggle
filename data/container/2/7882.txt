"The mood in the memoir of the life of Narciso Rodriguez is mostly how the bonds between him and his parents, and everyone around them got them through tough times. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 he states that in their neighborhood ""cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship"" And how ""immigrants extended helping hands to people, who were not only their own kind, but who needed a helping hand."" The author says that in his community many different cultures came together and help each other through racism, and other tough times. He says that ""family"" isn't just those you are related to blood, but those who are close to your heart."
