"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a sense of family. He says how when his parents came up to Newark, New Jersey, from Cuba, they had to start all over and find a new beginning. They passed on their rich culinary skills and love for Cuban food in the kitchen of a three-room apartment in a two family building. He says that the community was all a different race but they all became a big family that got through the racist times of the United States in the '@NUM1. He says that he will always be grateful to his parents for their extreme love and sacrifice. He reminds them constantly about how grateful he is and that he can't believe how they did it. So the mood in this memoir is about family."
