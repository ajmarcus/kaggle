"The mood created by the author in this memoir is love, and happiness. In the memoir the reader expresses the love and gratitude towards his parents. Not only did his parents love him; they quit their jobs and moved across the world just so they could give their son a better life. The authors parents risked so much for their son. The author states that he is very grateful for his parents, and that there is no way to express the love he feels for his parents. This memoir expresses the love, and gratitude in one's family, and how a little bit of caring can go a long way."
