"I think that the author concludes the story like that because @MONTH1 be she’s saying that by that time she’ll be ready to take the test again. Another way of thinking is that @MONTH1 be by that time when that happens in spring she would be preprared and more confident of herself. @MONTH1 be the author was trying to say that just like the begining of a new springs, it would be a new beginning for her."
