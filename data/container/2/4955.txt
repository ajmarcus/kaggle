"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in this story greatly. The cyclist is cycling in a desert, Ò...I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.Ó @CAPS1 it was hot and the sun is beating down on the cyclist, Òthe sun was beginning to beatdown...Ó @CAPS1 it is remote and there is no one to offer help or assistance, Ò...it fit the traditional definition of ghost town.Ó There are no natural water sources for the cyclist to refill his bottles of water. He might have died from dehydration. ÒI got down on my hands and knees and worked the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength, but only a tarlike substance oozed out.Ó There @CAPS1 was a poisonous snake on the road which could have bit the cyclist. @CAPS1, there were hills that required more energy to get up. Since the cyclist had to use more energy to get up the hills he got more tired and thirsty."
