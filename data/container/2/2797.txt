"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. For one just letting a thousand foot drigibles land on the top of a building was a huge obstacle.. By having the dirigible on the building held on by one cable tether was bad. So the builder had to work on the steel frame of the building so that the dirigible wouldn't add so much stress to the building. That was a huge obstacles the builders of the Empire State building had to face."
