"In the story, the setting greatly affects the cyclist. The cyclist, pedaling through California, is obviously very hot in the “beautiful @DATE1.” He also runs out of water, which nearly dooms him. But that’s not the worst of it. The hills make him run out of water and energy even quicker. There are also no places to stop for water. The cyclist is lucky he survived the rugged terrain of California."
