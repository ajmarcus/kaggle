"The author, @PERSON1 created a mood in the memoir. The mood he created was deffinitely loving and warm. For example, I would say this memoir's mood is loving and warm because the memoir kept mentioning how considerate, friendly, and passionate his family was. Also, he kept saying he learned what family was all about and he learned the true meaning of family. So, to me the mood in this memoir, is loving and warm.
