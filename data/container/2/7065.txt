"The last paragraph of the story was: When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. I think the author concluded the story with that paragraph to show that she is adapting and that she is starting to accept the change. I think that because throughout the story she is upset and not really liking the change. And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. The text says. This last paragraph seems optimistic talking about the flower blooming and the geese returning which seems like she is starting to accept the change. In my opinion, the author added  that paragraph to finish the story to show that Saeng is starting to accept the change and be optimistic."
