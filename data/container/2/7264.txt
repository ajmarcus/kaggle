"Narciso Rodriguez created a mood of happiness and comfort in the memoir. When he told that ""... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" it signaled to me that they all must be happy together. And when Rodriguez describes how all of the Cuban traditions his parents brought blended it just made me think he was comfortable with his home."
