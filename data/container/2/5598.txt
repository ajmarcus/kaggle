"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants to try again. So when she said “Then I will take that tes again”, it means she knows she has another chance. It shows that she is strong willed and wont give up easy. So what she is saying in the last paragraph is if you don’t succed the first time try and try again. In the story it says “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season”. In that part I can tell that she is already starting to change. So I think next time she’ll do great."
