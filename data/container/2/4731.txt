"The setting affect the cyclist because in the hot heat of California in June which nobody wants to be outside. But first, was the heat which took a lot out of his body while trying to keep it cool. Then came the factor of which he had very little water when he reached the first town and in the story it said, ÒA tar like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.Ó So now he has no cool water to drink when he says, ÒNot two miles into the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.Ó So the cyclist has very little water is not having to endoor the hardest part of the ride. Then later on he makes a mention to change a paragraph if he loss consciousness. Also he talked about him might getting a heatstroke. Hinting to the fact that the setting he was in was affecting him in many different ways."
