"The setting of “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed the Speed Limit” effects the cyclist in many was. The words “high deserts of California in June,” from the story show that it is very hot and dry. The cyclist get's very tired and in the desert there aren't big ponds to get water out of, so if you don’t have water you don’t have anything. Also the cyclist suffers the pain a difficulty of having to drive on, over and down rough terrain. In the story it is said there was a sign that said “Rough Road Ahead.” There were also obsticals such as tumbleweeds and snakes he had to get around. The dry, rough, dangerous setting put the cyclist life in danger, but because of dedication he got through it."
