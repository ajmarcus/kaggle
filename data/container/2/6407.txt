"The author concludes the story with this paragraph, “When they com back, Saeng vowed silently to hersef, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, Then I will take that test again”. I believe the author concluded the story like this because it shows that the hibiscus represented to Saeng a new beginning and to restart what she had failed. When Saeng saw the hibiscus after failing her driving test, it gave her com fort in a time of disappointment, connection to her past experiences, and the abilities she could overcome her obstacles. Therefore, when the narrator says, “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"", This implies a new beginning so the hibiscus is representing Saeng. This is why I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph."
