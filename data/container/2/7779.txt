"The mood is set to a sad feeling. Filled with poverty the auther sets it up this way. There is a mood of love too. For example in paragraph @NUM1, it says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" It also says that they learned the real definition of family. this is why it is set too a sadly love mood. They were an immigrants. This memoir is inspirational."
