"The features of the desert changed the way the speaker thought about his journey. When the road began the change, the speakers determination did too, Flat road were replaced by short hills. The terrain began to change and the speaker became doubtful of the old man that that directed him towards the shortcut. I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listned to some gentlemen who hadnt been off their porch in decades. The heat in desert made the speaker thirsty causing him to drink all his water. There was no source of water therefore he decided to suckenc-stone. Id read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst,. But the bumpy terrain didnt allow him to do that. He hit a bump and swallowed the stone. The speaker began to panice, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean. But luckily the author thoughts changed after he found a supply of water, the features did affect the cyclist very much."
