"The features of the setting affected the cyclist. The dry desert affected the cyclist because these was no water and the cyclist was dehydrated. The strong heat, because the cyclist could bare had a heat stroke. The animals because the snake could have killed the cyclist and these was no one in miles to help. In the story it says, ÒThese was no one in sight, not a bulling, car or structure of any kind,Ó If the cyclist had needed help then the  cyclist could most likely have died. if I was the cyclist, I probably would have given up by then but IÕm glad the cyclist didn`t. The features of the setting affected the cyclist because of the many things that could make happened to him."
