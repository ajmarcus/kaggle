The obstacles the buliders had to go through was preety hard. It was hard because the building was so high up in the air. They needed special gear to do it. Al Smith had to wait for an answer before building the mast because it was dangerous. Over sixty thousand dollars had to be made to the building framwork. The other obsticals were to drop and let passengers on. Also to refull your dirigibles if you had one. And it was just to make the building bigger.
