"The features of the setting that affected the cyclist was the heat because he was getting lost and he was slowly running out of water. The cyclist said, That you should never accept travel advice from old timers that havent left their porches since Carter was in office. This means that because the cyclist followed their advice he got lost in the desert and was running very low on water. He was thirsty that he put stones in his mouth to keep him from thinking about water. In the end the cyclist learned to trust the map and the signs instead of listening to really old people who havent left their homes in years."
