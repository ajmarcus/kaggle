"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author ends the story in a way that shows that she wants to start fresh. I think this because when she is talking to her mom at the end of the story, she says “In the spring, when this hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again”. She is saying that she wants to start over. and adapt to her new country. Also, I think this because she wants to wait until the seasons change to go take her test again. because she says “when the snow melts and the geese return.” She states this because she wants a completely new slate when she takes her test again. That is why I believe she wanted to conclude her story this way."
