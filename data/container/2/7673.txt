"There is a very distinct mood set by Narciso in this passage. He talks about Faith, love, courage, and just the overall niceness of his home and community. He speaks of the ""innocence of childhood"" and the ""gratitude for the spirit of generosity"" impressed upon him at a young age. I believe the mood is one of gratitude, gratitude of how his parents struggled to raise him right and well. He is grateful for his home, his family, and his community, of course he ""groups"" the last two together because of the deep, emotional way they all felt. Gratitude is one thing so he doesn't have."
