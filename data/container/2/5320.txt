"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the story started out by Saeng failing the test, going out and buying a plant to comfort her and confessing to her mom. The plant related to her by the memories of her homeland and when she failed that test she felt very depressed and sad. She cried to show her pain, and bought a plant to cheer her up. As she told her mom she felt the pain again but, her mother made her favorite food and helped her plant the plant. She knew that it wasnt like the old plant but, it was the thought and memories she knew that she couldnt just give up, so when it came the right time she was going to try the test again. It relates because it helps the readers understand the story a little better and shows that she wasnt going to just quit. Her mother was very understanding and when she goes to retake the test she will be prepared. That is how it relates back to the story."
