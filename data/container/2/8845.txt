"The mood created by the author in the memoir is courage. ""I will always be greatful to my parent for their love & sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. Another example of courage is how ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in a country they loved. This is the mood the author creates in this memoir."
