"The Author of “Winter Hibiscus”, Minfong Ho, concluded hes story with the paragraph about how when the geese are there, and the hibiscus is blooming, Saeng will take her drivers test again, because she wanted to end on a happy note. In the begining of the story, Saeng, who had just moved from Vietnam to the @LOCATION2, failed her drivers test. She had found a plant they had back in Vietnam, but it made her sad. “I mean it’s not like the kind we had at – at-"" she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.” (Ho, @NUM1) So by ending by describing positive things for the future, Saeng could think about that, and get her mind off of everything else."
