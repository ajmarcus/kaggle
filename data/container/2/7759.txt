"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives a certain mood was created. The type of mood that was created by the author is a warm and @CAPS1 mood. It was because of the different things that were happening in this community, and more importantly the house. This house had become a home to Narciso because of all the different that would happen there. like the Cuban music, the constant in and out of extended family members, and the fact that this all happened because his parents selflessly came to this country to give him a better life, even though they had to leave behind their families, careers, in the country they loved. This is the mood created by the author in this memoir."
