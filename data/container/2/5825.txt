"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show if they can adapt then she can too. In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. I choose this saying because it shows you if they are able to come back after everything that has happen she can to. She should be able to adapt to a new place just like they do."
