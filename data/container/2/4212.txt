"The features of this setting effect the author while he is cycling. They changed his hope to doubt. There were no buildings or cars, which led him to believe he would never get to Yosemite. Also, it had a rough terrain that made him doubt that he would ever get water. Im sure if the setting had buildings, people, even just civilization, then the cyclist would of been fine."
