"The features of the setting affect a cyclist in many ways. If you have a bumpy ride, then the cyclist will have a harder time. also, if it is really hilly, then it is harder and will take longer too. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills, It will take him longer to reach his destination. animals in the setting can also be effective. and a ridiculously, large snake-it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. animals can get in the way like this snake did for the cyclist. If a squirrel or some kind of animal was to run across the rode right infront of you, it could scare you and you could clash. Sometimes trees make it cooler because you dont have to sun beating directly down on your back. If there is a fresh water stream you can stop and wash all the sweat off of you and get a drink. The setting in which is cyclist is riding, can help or hurt the cyclist."
