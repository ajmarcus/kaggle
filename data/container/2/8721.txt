"The mood created by the author in this memoir is comforting. His memoir shows his past life and how he felt about it. Cuban music filled the air, tables of Cuban feasts, different kinds of people interacting, all that is the mood he's trying to express about his life through his memoir. He's also showing his appreciation for his parent for making sacrafices for him so he could have more opportunities and education. He's also being very descriptive about his childhood and showing the type of life he had and what he and his parents had to go through when they came to @LOCATION1 and how they don't want people going through the same thing as them so they helped Immigrants who needed support."
