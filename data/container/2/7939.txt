"The mood created by the author in the memoir is Love. In paragraph @NUM1. It says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This means that there will always be love and happiness in your home if you just respect your friends and your loved ones. Life would be good."
