"In the memoir the mood created by the author I think was more of a serious, informative, and uplifting mood. The reason for why I think this is that the way his lifestyle is described as a happy and enjoyable life of also being able to talk about some serious topics like his culture and the diversity of the cultures of the poeple that live on the street. Also by how he feels so confortable with all the people that are in his apartment building and all the people that come to his house for dinner to call them family."
