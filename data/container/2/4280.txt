"In the passage, the features of the setting affect the cyclist because every time he comes along something different a new idea about his survival comes into his head. First, when the cyclist sees the mule he says, This sight was troubling, he is now troubled by the fact that he had not seen a town yet and starting to doubt the old mens advise. Also, when he sees the juice factory he puts some pebbles in his mouth and says, It didnt really matter, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean. This shows that seeing the broken down juice factory gave him no hope and he tells his self that he will die."
