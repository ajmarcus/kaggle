"I believe the author of “winter Hibiscus “ends the story like she did because saeng agrees to take the test again. She wants to take the test when the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. In other words when spring has come she will be ready for the test.  Saeng states in the story “it’s the flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, thes winte hibiscus. That’s what matters.” I think saeng is using this as a guiding light since she just moved from Vietnam. She plans to make it and use the plant as a symbol. She will try again for her drivers license at the start of spring."
