"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by getting dehydrated, getting tired, and by getting lost. After the cyclist was on the road for a while he had drank almost all of his water, but he still had a while to go before he got to his destination. He was going to try to find some where to stop so he could pick up more water but there was nothing around. He also got tired because he was out in the sun, had barley any water, and he didnt know where he was going. One last example was that he was lost. There were no cars, buildings, or people. So if he were to get hurt or sick no one would have been able to help him. In conclusion, being dehydrated, tired and getting lost were the features of the setting affect the cyclist had."
