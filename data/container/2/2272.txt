"The excerpt of The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon LŸsted reveals that the architects of the Empire State faced a number of obstacles. Not only was the construction of the building now competive, but its expectations were unrealistic. The idea for such a masterpiece of a building held a number of potential problems that its architects not very competitive. As the work-in-progress of the Chrysler building grew, the Empire State Building strived to be taller. In order to achieve greater heights, its architects suggested and addition of a mooring mast, to not only make the building the tallest, but to add to its purpose. The addition of a mooring mast would require a lot of planning, though. If a giant steel framed balloon were to dock at the top of the building as is, it could dangerously shake the foundation of the building, so the frame of the building had to be rebuilt much stronger. Also, the architects didn't realized the danger of docking dirigibles. Dirigibles, or blimps, were fueled by hydrogen, which is very flammable, and proved a threat to the thousands of people living below."
