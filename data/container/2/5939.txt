"I think the author ends the story with this paragraph for many reasons. One reason is because It leaves you knowing that Saeng will never give up tring.

Saeng says that flower is something so important, that working harder will encourage her to keep doing the best she can. The author leaves you with this sentence because it is very powerful and brings Saeng courage.  "
