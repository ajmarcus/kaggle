"The reason why the author, Minfong Ho, finished the story Winter Hibiscus on with the last paragraph  was due to in the story the girl went out on a test. And on this test which I do not know what the test is, she failed it and returns with a saebba hedge. This is a tamed plant for the family. The family loves this plant. They are what I understand from the story, newcomers to a country. And the country is @LOCATION1. Theyve moved here from Vietnam. She goes for her driving test and comes home failed. One of the things her mother asks, why do you spend so much money on this beautiful plant when you could a had the famed bee-maags which is the mothers attempt to say a Big Mac which is their favorite fast food sandwich. But the reason why the daughter comes back with the plant is she has failed her parents on the driving test. She wants to go back and try again. Then the snow will melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will return to take the test again. She believes the next time she goes, she will pass the test and that she will not be ashamed of it and that she will make her parents proud by passing the test due to it is a high honor to the family, I believe, from what I am getting from this. In Vietnam not many people drive and that they want their daughter to earn this and it is something they do not have."
