"There were a few challenges that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The mast couldn't just be dropped on the top of the building. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" All this stress would be transmitted to the foundation of the building. Another obstacle was the builders had to modify the whole building. The architects had designed the mooring mast and made changes to existing plans for the building's skeleton."" The builders already had the building done but in order to dock the dirigibles, they needed to change the building. These architects worked hard to build something that could never be used because of the violent air currents. ""Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The architects put all their hard work into remodeling the building for nothing."
