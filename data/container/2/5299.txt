"The setting of the story, are very dry and humid, and flat, and hilly. The author noticed the terrain changing, Flat road. Was replaced by short, rolling hills (Joe kurmaskie). Being out in the middle of a dessert like surronding during June, and nothing surronding him is a scary thought. The heat, and lack of water affect him, by him possibly getting mirages, or he @MONTH1 faint, because of the heat, and how much fluid he has lost. The hills dont help any eigther."
