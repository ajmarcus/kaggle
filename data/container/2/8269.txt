The mood created by the author was a very unique one. The author was remembering and charising the memorys he had of his old home. He described his home by saying how brave and courageous his parents were to give him a better life also how his family was so rich in culture and how his family and neighbors would always visit because times were tough but the authors parents never turned them down. The author made it sound that it was the perfect childhood and described it with such detail and passian and that is why the mood is so unique and special.
