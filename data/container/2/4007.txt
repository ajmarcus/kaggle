"The features of the setting negatively affect the cyclist. When the cyclist arrived at the first “town”, he could tell there’d be some issue. It was a deserted, run down area. The water was hot. Down the road the setting started to change from flat land to hills. There was a big snake in the road. He was becoming very dehydrated going through hilly areas with little to no water."
