"There are few moods created. They are comfort, Love and sacrifice. Comfort because of the way @PERSON1 described his home, parents, and neigborhood families. Love because his parents loved him and each other very much, and they cared about what they did and their family. Sacrifice because his parents sacrificed their comforting home to move to @LOCATION1 for their son. That was difficult for them, but @ORGANIZATION1 appreciated that. He loves his parents what they did for him."
