The mood created by the author in the memoir is lifting. The mood created by the author is lifting because it shows that race doesn't matter when it comes to unity or friendship. It is also lifting because Narciso's parents gave up everything and everyone so that their family can live a better life. Another reason why it is lifting is because in the story it talks about how the family doesn't have to neccisarily blood related and can be someone you love and will help you. That is why I think the mood created by the author in the memoir is lifting.
