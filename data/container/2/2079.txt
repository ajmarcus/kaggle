The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles while building it One obstacle they hit was the dirigibles couldnt dock there because of no mooring mast When the architects and engineers built the building they put a flat roof which the Mooring Mast could not be placed on. They said that the frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to fix the situation. Another obstacle was they couldnt have a Rope holding the Mooring Mast up because the dirigibles wouldnt hold it up. Those are some obstacles the architechs went threw.
