"There were many obstacles that the @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building faced one of them were redesigning some parts of the Empire State Building. The @CAPS1 job was to create the mast for docking new airships called dirigible or blimps. This plan came with great difficulty, they couldn't drop on mooring mass on top of the Empire State buildings flat roof. They came to figure out that a ""thousand-foot dirigible moored held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). This stress would have to be transmitted to the buildings foundation.     The @CAPS1 had to modified and strengthened the steelframe in order to accommodate the situation of the stress on the building frame Also creating the rocket shaped mass the @CAPS1 had to work on many different parts. The winches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring. This had to be done presisely in order for everything towork     This were the obstacles the @CAPS1 face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock in the Empire State building."
