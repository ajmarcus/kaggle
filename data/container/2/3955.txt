"The setting affected the cyclist in many ways, One way was the weather. In the story it said I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June (kermaskie @NUM1). Thats quote said he is in a desert and desert are usally warm. It also said in June and June is usally a hot temp month. The weath affected the cyclist because it was hot and he started to become dehydrated and had little water. Another way the setting affected the cyclist was the souroundings. In the story it said. There was no one in sight not a building, car or structure of any kind (kurmaskie). That saying there know one around to help him so if he gets hurt or something. Also theres no where to get some water."
