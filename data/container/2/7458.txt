"Narciso Rodriguez could not describe his home any better, it was as if I was there with him. I can see he really remembers the sound, shites, and smells of his home. ""...situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culture. Passionate Cuban music... filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" That whole paragraph really gave me a good feeling, and I could tell the mood was always a happy one considering all the festivities. Therefore the mood is happy and warm, I would love to be there."
