"The mood in the memoir doesn't change alot. Narciso Rodriguez mood is happy in the end because @CAPS1 says ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" @CAPS1 also says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS2 there I think Narciso is happy. The mood is mostly calm & happy because @CAPS1 telling the courage his parents had. Thats the mood the author gave."
