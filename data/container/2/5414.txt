"I think that the author made that the concluding sentence because it means that when Saeng is ready then she will take the test again. I think that she is comparing herself to the snow, the snow the geese, and the hibiscus. I think so because she says that when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding then she will take the test again. So I think that she is saying that she is not ready for the test and when she does get ready then that is when she will take it."
