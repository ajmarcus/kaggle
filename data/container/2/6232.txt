"The last paragraph of “Winter Hibiscus” describes determination and the growth of a person. Saeng says that when “this hibiscus is budding,  then I will take that test again.” Just as the hibiscus blooms Saeng will bloom forth and strive through the winter to try and succeed in passing her test. Saeng concludes by saying this as a realization that she can’t be sad forever. She must be determined in order to pass the test. The next season will be a sort of renewal, starting fresh and coming out beautiful as does a hibiscus in bloom."
