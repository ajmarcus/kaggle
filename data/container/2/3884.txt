"The setting causes difficult problems for the cyclist and tough hazards. The weather is hot and just going through hot weather is tough enough, but giving through a desert with limited water had to be miserable. The warmth of the desert had an affect on the cyclist and caused him to be fatigue. This delayed him from getting to his destination quicker as well. Not only did he have to through tough weather but hazardous condition too. There were times when tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. This delayed him and took time to cycle around. As you can see this was a difficult journey for the reader and the affected the cyclist."
