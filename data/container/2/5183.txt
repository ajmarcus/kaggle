"The way the settings affect the cyclist is very crucel. First, the cyclist took directions from someone who has not left thier porch in decades. So once he accepted the directions and used them problems occurred. One main problem is the cyclist has a lack of water supply. Also the cyclist has incounters with snakes. Another the directions where way off so he had longer to go then he thought. Also when he arrived from his journey he found a deserted town. So in conclusion the cyclest uses his own directions from now on."
