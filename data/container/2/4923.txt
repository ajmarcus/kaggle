"Many things that involve settings can affect other things. In the Do not exceed the posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie, a cyclist is affected by the setting as he travels to Yosemite National park. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day. (kurmaskie @NUM1). The sertting from the day is affecting him very much and it is hard for him to continue. He is very tired and almost sick from the heat. The settings of this place are hurting to the cycleist and he wants to go home and away from the heat. The setting of this place effects the cyclist very much."
