"There is actually more than one mood that is set in this memoir. The most important one, though, is admiration. The author focuses his writing on the many positive actions and characteristics of his parents during his childhood. He admires their courage to come to @LOCATION1 in order to start a new life, despite hard times and rascism. He also praises their willingness to help other immigrants and stick with everyone while they create a new beginning. The other mood in the memoir is gratitude. The author looks back on everything his parents did for him many times. He credits them with turning their small, poor apartment into a home for him, and teaaching him the true meaning of being family. The author, in a way that reaches out to readers, thanks his parents for making him into who he is."
