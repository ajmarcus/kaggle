"The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir was, gratitude towards his parents.In the memoin the @CAPS1 thanks his parents for raising him the way they did. In the article he thanks them by saying things like ""my admiration"", ""my gratitude"", and ""generosity"". all these statements are true and they reflect his mood towards his family.In conclusion, the mood was alot of thing but, i choose gratitude because it reflects how he feels about his family the most."
