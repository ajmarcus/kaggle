"The author created several different moods in this memoir. The main mood that the author was trying to creat was thankfulness. In paragraph @NUM1 it says,"" I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows thankfulness because she's saying thank you to her parents and everything they have done for her. Also, she is thankful because she started to realize how hard her mom and dad had to work for the house and put food on the table. The main mood of the story is clearly thankfulness."
