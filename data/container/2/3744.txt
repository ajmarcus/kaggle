"In the short story, Rough Road Ahead, the cyclist faced with many problems. One of these is the feature of setting. I believe it has a big affect. The setting is in a dessert, which is very hot, there is no water around and usually nobody lives in a dessert. @CAPS1 thing is that he was running out of water. In the text it says, The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. @CAPS1 setting of the book that affects the cyclist is that it is in June. June is a very hot month, especially when the cyclist is in a dessert traveling many miles."
