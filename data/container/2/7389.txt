"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created in the memoir is a comfortable one. I know this because in paragraph three it says ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" That shows that he was comfortable in that house and neighborhood that he had developed a family other than his blood relatives. Also in the last sentence of this memoir it says ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" That shows that the house had to be comfortable to him if he calls at home, because a home is a place for someone fells safe and comfortable."
