"As he began his journey, he had full confidence in the directions given given to him by the old men. After he came to the first town and there was no water, he rode on. After he found an “ramshackle shed” he became troubled , as he “had been “hitting“ his “water bottles regularly“ and was traveling through the “desert of California in June” and was running low on water. Coming to a place where he saw a building over hills, he “manuevered” his way down, only to find it long  deserted and himself close to despair. He was desparate for water he needed it soon. Finally, he came upon “@CAPS1 and Wilber’s Fish Camp” and quenched his thirst, and was relieved. Then on  he wised up, and took no more directions from old men who knew little to nothing about cycling."
