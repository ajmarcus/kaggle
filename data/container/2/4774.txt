"When the bicyclist was trying to find Yosemite he stumbled into a million setting. One in the begining when he was talking to the old men on the porch and having him set of into the distance of nothing but dessert. one rameshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnt hold in the lamest mule greeted me. Its only him. At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake  it really did look like ma diamond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. Tumble weed usually mean's desert. He also saw the @CAPS1 grape juice factory and the bait store where he finally found someone else to give him directions."
