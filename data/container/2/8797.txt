"In the excerpt, the author created a relaxed tone in the memoir. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"". This shows how equipped his parents were with Cuban culture. Culture was a big piece of Narciso Rodriguez child hood and life. ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"". This shows that the author is trying to focus your attention on the culture of the @CAPS1 and that the house was relaxed and calm which is the tone of the author."
