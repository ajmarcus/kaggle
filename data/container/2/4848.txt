The features of the setting affects the cyclist. Because the man didnt have a lot of water and he was go into the California deserts in June. Another reason is because the flat road was changed into rolling hills and up ahead there was a sign that said Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit. the speed limit was @NUM1. One more thing is make sure you dont listen to a gentleman that is old and hadnt be off ther porch in decades. That is some of the things that can affect the cyclist.
