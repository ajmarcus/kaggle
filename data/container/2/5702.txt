"The author ends the story like this in comparing to adapting changing or doing everything all over again for example; The geese fly  away when it gets cold but they always  come back giving their home another  chance .The Hibiscus is another  fine example , it buds  in  @DATE1  always  but  doesnt  die  in  winter.  It always  returns . Saeng  has obviously realized  this  and vowed to  try her  drivers  test  again because it might work  this time . The author was trying to get the message spread of , dont  give  up."
