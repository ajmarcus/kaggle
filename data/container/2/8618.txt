"I think the mood of the memoir is comforting and happy because it talks about how a simple house became a home. The memoir shows how a family can turn a random house into a home would love and by selflessly letting people stay with them until they can get back on their feet. The memoir also shows how family has nothing to do with being blood relaited, it's about being their for one another in a time of need. I think that shows a great amount of comfort and happiness, knowing that a simple apartment could become a loveing home, filled with family and love."
