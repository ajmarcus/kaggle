"The author creates a very warm happy welcoming feeling by describing how friends and family are always visiting and how happy the family is all the time. The author Narciso Rodriguez never mentions any bad times and shows how kind everyone is. This quote from the memoir proves that Narciso is creating a good mood throughout the story.""The innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote i think shows very well that the author is creating a happy mood in his memoir."
