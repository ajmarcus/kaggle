"In the short story ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood of the short story is grateful and reasonable. In the story a man named Narciso Rodriguez twenty-seven years old migrated from Cuba in 1956 with his parents to come to the United States. When they came they had to live in a one bedroom apt. they could afford nothing else. But Narciso was being very greatful. Even though they had nowhere to to work in places with bigger pay. So they only had little pay to feed there family. Narciso is greatful in paragraph @NUM1. @CAPS1 says ""They struggle both personally and finanacially braving the harsh northern winters."" @CAPS1 had to settle for what was given to him at the time."
