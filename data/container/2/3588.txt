"The setting effects the cyclist because of the setting were diffrent the story would not of made sense. The setting of the story is not and dry with scaterd ghost towns. When he reaches the first town he sees One ramshackle sheds several rusty pumps and a coral that couldnt hold the lamesh mule. If the setting had the problem of no water so there would be no conflict in the story, In the story the speeker says I was travling through the high deserts of California that are very hot and dry, and he says This causes the problem of it being hot and dry if the seting was a forest in @DATE1 he wouldnt have as much of a problem needing water which would of made the story much less exciting."
