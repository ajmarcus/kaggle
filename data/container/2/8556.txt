"The author creates a verry good mood in the story. It is a mood of well-being and happiness in their family. I think the author has a verry good bond with his family. I think that because he talks about being with his family alot listening to Cuban Music and eating dinner together. He also appreciates his parents alot because they left cuba to come to the United States so he would have a better life. In paragraph @NUM1 he says ""I will always be greatful to my parents love and sacrifice""."
