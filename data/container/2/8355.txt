"The mood in the memoir represents friendship, family, helpfulness, one example of helpfulness is in the @NUM1 paragraph it says ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hard working, immigrints who extend a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own Kind, were clearly in need."" @CAPS1 good example of the mood in this memoir is family but also ties back to helping is in paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we concider family. Knowing that they would do the same for us. This is what the memoir is about."
