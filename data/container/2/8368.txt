"The author's mood that is created in the memoir is love and gratitude. The author expresses how thankful he is of his parents to live and grow up in the home they made for him. He says that he knows that family is not just blood related. He tells how his parents had open arms and doors to people in the community who needed help. Their home was filled with @CAPS1 music, food and love. They would have celebrations of his birthday's and people's arrival to the new country. There was this atmosphere of love and thankfulness in his life and that is expressed in this memoir."
