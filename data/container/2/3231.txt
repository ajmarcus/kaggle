"Obstacles the builders of the empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, were not easy to overcome. Most dirigible were massive, @CAPS1 by in this quote dealing with them was no easy task. ""@CAPS2 as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York."" In this quote it tells of their massive size and proves how difficult it would be to control and land them safetly.Another obstacle the workers had to face is modifying the already set structure of the empire state building, also money spent as @CAPS1 by in this quote. ""The Steel frame of the empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over Sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework."" This quote proves that the addition of the mooring mast would be not only tirering for the workers, but also alot of money would be spent on a failed project. They got their tall building, but were unable to achieve mooring mast."
