"I believe that the author concluded the story with this paragraph for several reasons. This final paragraph draws together and unites all the final paragraph on concluding idea. It tells us that in the spring when everything is coming to life Saeng will find the strength to take the test again. These central ideas expressed in thelast paragraph show how Saeng and her mother have adapted and that new things are started in the spring, as well as new possibilities. In the text it says, “I know"", her mother said quietly. “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. It’s flower aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.” This means and represents that even though life is different here away from Saeng home they will adapt and survive in their own way."
