"In the memoir, the author describes his home enviroment while growing up. As a child, his home has given off a very happy and loving mood. One in which was created again in this memoir. When describing the culinary and musical habits in his home as a child, I can feel the happiness that the moment had possessed. Also, I can feel the love between himself and his constantly growing family that surrounds his kitchen table @TIME1. So, to me, this memoir gives off a great mood. One filled with happiness, love, and loyalty. Also with unity and friendship as well."
