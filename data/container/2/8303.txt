"The mood that the author was trying to create was a sense of hope, family and happiness. Hope was @CAPS1 because his family helped others by letting them temporarily stay with them until they got back on there feet which provided hope for the extended family. Family was @CAPS1 be cause in the last paragraph he is explaining how in this tiny apartment you learned the definition of ""family"" through welcoming refugees and celebrating his first birthdays and having a loving, careing enviroment. Finally I think happiness was @CAPS1 because he was explaining how grateful he was for his parents coming to america to give him a better life and also in paragraph two he was explaining how his home environment was filled with cooking and music which can be factors of happiness. These are some moods that the author was trying to show."
