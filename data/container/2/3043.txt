"The experts faced a few major obstacles in the building of the Empire State building.  One of those major obstacles was the frame work.  When your going to build a 1,250 foot building and have a air craft land on it, you need a good and well designed frame.  What they did was add a stainless steal and chrome-nickle windows to cut down on pressure.  They spent over sixty thousand dollars on modifications to the skeleton of the Empire State building.  The other main issue was the air currents.  You can not strapp a dirigible and believe the back of it swaying back and worth.  When your almost a 11 @NUM1 ft in the air, the wind can be very violent at that height.  If the dirigible ever came off or unhooked before they were done refueling, the dirigible would crash and burn, hundreds of pedestrian on the ground below.  Al Smith had a great idea but he did not realize all the problems."
