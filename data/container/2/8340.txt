"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in this memoir. Is a very happy and grateful mood. It is happy because in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, Formed the backdrop to life and are warm home. It is grateful because he says in paragraph @NUM2 ""They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it means leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. In paragraph @NUM3 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice. This is the mood created in this excerpt."
