"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows how sometimes you have to wait till the time right for you to try again... For example, In the book it says Madagascar periwinkle, its tag announced, How strang to see it in apat, Back home it just grew wild jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between roofs. This shows that anything can be done when the time is right."
