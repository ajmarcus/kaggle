"The @CAPS1 who made the Mooring mast faced many obstacals when trying to get dirigibles to dock. Some were safty, nature its self, and pre existing laws. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The greatest obstacal was nature. Winds at the top were always changing and could make the dirigibles crash to the mast. An existing law prevented airships to fly too low in urban cities. For all the work the @CAPS1 put into the mast it could never live up to its potential."
