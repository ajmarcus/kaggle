"In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, Narciso really sets, a joyous, happy mood when @CAPS1 describes his home. @CAPS1 gives the reader a feeling of just how much @CAPS1 loved his home. @CAPS1 sets a mood of gratefulness as well, when @CAPS1 describes how much is parents sacrificed for him to grow up well. ""There is no way for me to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity at such an early age, and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" @CAPS1 sets such an ecstatic mood, that the reader wants to be there, at his home. This is a mood that Narciso Rodriguez sets, and the way @CAPS1 shows the reader just how great his home really is."
