"The setting in Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit greatly affected the cyclist in the story. Not two miles into this next reaction of ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills (kurmaskie). the cyclist is travelling through hot, dry California in the middle of June without much water left. The fact that he now has to travel up and down short hills is going to make him even more tired, because going over hills requires more energy, than flat riding. This energy, loss coupled with the cyclist lack of water causes him to become even more miserable. The setting of this story greatly affected the cyclist."
