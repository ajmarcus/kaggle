The @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the lack of a suitable land area. Another Obstacle they faced was that the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. They also had to make shore that No sharp objects would punkener the dirigibles. These are the @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire state building faced.
