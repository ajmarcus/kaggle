"The idea of dirigibles being able to dock at such an altitude to begin with was foolish. First off trying to tie a thousand-foot dirigible to a building by a single tether adds huge stress to the building's frame. They were able to fix that problem, but the main issue they couldn't fix was mother nature. The wind speed at that height is incredibly violent and would cause the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast. Overall the project was just doomed to fail from the start."
