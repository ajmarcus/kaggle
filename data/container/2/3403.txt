"The future of allowing dirigibles to dock on the top of the Empire State Building became unrealistic when issues of safty came forward and when test runs did not go as planned. Some dirigibles used hydrogen rather than hellium which could be flamable. ""the owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse than accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area."" By placing a dock in the heart of New York City its risking the lives of too @CAPS1 passengers and citizens.When the dock was in place at the top of the Empire state building two dirigibles tried landing but both times it was a failure. There were @CAPS1 problems and landing, one being the wind. ""dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" @CAPS1 dangers stop this plan to happen."
