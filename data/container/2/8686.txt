"In this memoir the author gives the mood a sense of inspiration, as well as the love of family and friends. In the memoir the author talks about how great it is that the author's parents had turned a simple ordinary house into a home, which means that the author's parents had made thier house to feel like home by bringing their Cuban culture into the house, such as Cuban food, Cuban music, and Cuban decoration. That makes the memoir a happy mood. But there is also inspiration to this memoir because it basically tells readers that it doesn't matter who your blood relatives are, family is family, people who love and care about you the most."
