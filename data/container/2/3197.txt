"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many different obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. The major obstacle to allow dirigibles to dock there was the lack of a suitable landing area. To allow dirigibles to anchor at empire state building for several hours a mooring mast had to be added to the top of the building. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire buildings flat roof, so rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside. Once architects had designed the mooring mast it could be complete and useful. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of mooring mast was nature itself. Those are some of the obstacles the builders had to face to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire State building."
