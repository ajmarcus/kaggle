"In the story Narciso Rodriguez by The blueprints of our lives, the author's mood in this story is very happy, generous, and humble. The author is so happy that she is moving to a new, and bigger house. This one she can actually call home. And very generous because her parents moved for her education. and to get good money to make us happy. The girl's parents welcome anyone into their home as family, and thats why she loves them too. But I have to say she's mostly grateful. Because her parent's are doing every thing to make her happy, and they even have to accept getting a job they dont even like. And for their love and sacrifice. And that's what mood the author feel's in the story."
