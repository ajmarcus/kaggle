"I think the mood of author in the memoir is thankful, proud and happy. @PERSON1 is extremely thankful of what is has, disspite what has happened through his life. He is proud of his Cuban heritage and is still proud of it today. He listens to Cuban Music and cooks Cuban food. Also his is happy. In the memoir he has a very happy tone because is his proud and thankful. His parents were immigrants from Cuba and he still got the education he wanted, even though his parents went through tough times."
