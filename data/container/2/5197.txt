"The setting in the story affected the cyclist physically and mentally. They affected him physically because of the rough terrain and the heat because he was in a desert and in the mountains. Also because he didnt follow his plan on the map he had no cloe where he was and so I think the anxiety of the whole thing took a toll on his physical well being. It affected him mentally because every town he passed through, or every building he passed was deserted and he had no idea where any people were so that had to stress him out. This mentally messed him and he thought he was going to die, thats not good for anyone. I really think he should just do what he thinks is right and not listen to crazy old men anymore. Maps dont go crazy and they dont really get outdated, and maps dont lie to you so he obviously learned his lesson."
