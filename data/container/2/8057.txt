"The mood created by the author in the memoir are pretty good. The author shows that he really does appreciate his parents and thanks them for everything they've done. He calls his home a warm home. He remembers the inocence of childhood, congregation of family, friends, and endless celebrations. He states that he had a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. And I think what he's trying to say is you dont need to be blood rellated to be family, just love and care about someone."
