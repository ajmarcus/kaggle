"The mood created by the author in the memoir is pride. I think that the mood created by the author is pride because in paragraph two it says ""...culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" I think it's an example of pride because it says ""for which I am eternally grateful."" showing that will always be proud of Cuban food.  Another reason why I think the mood is pride is in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..."" I also think that is an example of pride because it shows that he was raised with Cuban music and he still loves to listen to it."
