"There were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow derigibles to dock there. In the excerpt the author states nature is one of the biggest problems for the mast. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The author explains that the wind on top of the buildings are dangerous for the dirigible. ""The winds on top of the buildings were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". The author also describes what the dirigible would do as an affect of the wind. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Those were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow derigibles to dock there."
