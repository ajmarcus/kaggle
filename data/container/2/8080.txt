"There are many ways to describe the mood in ""Home: The @CAPS1 prints of Our Lives"", by Narciso Rodriguez. First, the mood is family-friendly. This is because in paragraph @NUM1, the author states ""the innocence of child hood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, forms the backdrop to life in our warm home."" Also, the mood is very joy ful. In paragraph @NUM2, the author states, ""all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" @CAPS2, the mood of this memoir is defining the love of his family. In paragraph @NUM3, Narciso states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" These have been some moods in this story."
