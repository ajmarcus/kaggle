"The features of the setting effect the cyclist .The setting makes him feel thirsty, dry, hot, and lost. In the story the setting plays a big party in the cyclist's will to ride to the next town. First the cyclist asks directions from a guy that never left his house in decades this creates, doubt. Also in the story it says Tumbleweeds cross my path this makes the cyclists feel lost. Finally it say the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. This makes the cyclist thirsty and tired. The features definatly have an effect on the cyclists."
