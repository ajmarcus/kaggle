"The mood created by the author of this memoir was very warm and loving. He talks about his family and friends throughout the piece, and how much they have changed his life. He talks about Cuba and its culture flowing through the home, how his parents threw their careers away so that their children can have a good life, and how everyone in his neighborhood was very close knit as if they were a family. All these aspects of his life thrown together with words like ""faith"", ""struggle"", ""admiration"" and ""selflessly"", among many others, makes for a very compelling piece that has a strong heartfelt mood."
