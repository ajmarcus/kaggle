"There are afew obstacles the builders had. to face in this project. One of them was was building the Empire State Building taller than the Chrysler building. The architect building of the Chrysler building made it 46 ft taller. When this was done the builder needed to make the Empire State building taller, but make it something ""as mundane as a water tank"" (@NUM1  Al Smith) Another example was trying to make it a stop for dirigibles. These things could go up two @NUM2 miles per hour. They were as long a 1 thousand ft. That would take up @NUM3 blocks New York City. They didn't have good landing area. A third obstacle they faced was nature. The wind was always blowing. No matter what they need hangin dirigibles over a city of innocent people was very dangerous."
