"The mood created by the author memoir is... LOVE and Sacrifice. He often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. As he was growing up in his environment instilled in him a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. He often told them of his admiration for their strength and perseverance, and he thanked them repeatedly. As he say ""he will never forget how his parents turned this simple house into a home""."
