"The mood in this memoir is caring and loving. Even though everyone in the neighborhood isnt blood related they are all still family. Everyone in the neighborhood is so welcoming, he tells us how his mother always leaves the door open for those who welcome her in. When they all have partys everyone is so happy to have what they have. Narciso is over greatfull for what a life his parents give him and he can never thank them enough. He says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house to a home."" His parents are also very greatfull for how thankfull Narciso is.  Everyone in this ""family"" will forever love eachother"
