"Based on this excerpt, the architects had to go through a lot of obstacles in order to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. First they had to redesign the building's frameworks because the weight of the dirigible would add stress to it. Then they added two more floors to the top of the building. They were to be the boarding area for the passengers. Two months after they finally reframed the building, they put the American flag at the top of the mooring mast. Soon after, they realized proceeding with these designs were foolish because it was unsafe and not practical. Those are obstacles that the architects had to go through in order to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building."
