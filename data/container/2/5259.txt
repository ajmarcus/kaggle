"The older men gave him directions that were acctully really bad. Nature wasn’t on is side that’s for sure. First of all he ran out of water because of the heat. Secondly a snake blocked his path and he didn’t want to tempt it. Thirdly he became so overheated that it was possible for him to suffer a heat stroke in the middle of nowhere. Also he kept going to abandoned buildings. It was so bad that the stone relied on for his thirst got stuck in his throat, he was then lead to a bait shop that was absolutely in the middle of nowhere and he had no way of getting home."
