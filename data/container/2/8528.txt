"The mood of this passage is very warm and personal. Narciso is very reflective in this passage about how his parents were so unselfish and gave up their life in Cuba to give Narciso a better life. Narciso goes on saying how unselfish his parents are, and how they take people in to give other people a better life not just themselves. Narciso's parents were very caring, and very meaningfull to him. He continues the mood by talking about what a true family is. How it's not just someone your blood related to, but who you care about and love."
