"Throughout this @CAPS1 there is a very happy and loving vibe. This is shown in paragraph @NUM1, ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in a warm home. This paints a glorious picture of what @CAPS2 life in the house was like. Another example in the text is at the end, in paragraph @NUM2, ""I will never forget how my parents turned a simple house into a home."" This shows with happiness and love, It does not matter how rich you are, or what you own. Anything can be a home."
