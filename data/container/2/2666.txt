"The main problem they had with the docking of the dirigibles was it would have to be really safe. To hold the aircraft down they would have to use lead weights. I weights fell from the top of the building in such a dense, populated area it would be very dangerous. Also when the owners of the Empire State got notice of the hindenburg blowing up they felt uneasy. Even if the aircraft was floating moored to the top of the building the wind would whip it around making it even more unsafe. The idea was good but not probable to be safe."
