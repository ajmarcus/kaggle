"The mood that was created by the author in the memoir would be I believe love. I said love because basically throughout the whole story all that was being talked about was ""eternal @CAPS1"", ""a dore"", bonds, and unity. The family are imigrants and they came looking for a better lifestyle in a foreign country Just for the benefit of the children. From my point of view only loving parent would give up The country they all love in order to do something like that because they had to leave behind families, friends, and careers. Now their facing cultural hardships over Just one desition."
