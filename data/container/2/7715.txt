"In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, The mood was pretty much the same throughout. The mood in this @CAPS1 of writing was very happy. Narciso Rodriguez was very grateful and happy throughout the @CAPS1. He would always say that he was very grateful for his Parents being all nice and coming over here to the united States from Cuba to give him a better life. Also, his family gave up their friends and family, good jobs and all said goodbye. Just to have a chance at a new and better life. He was also very happy, because even though he wasnt in Cuba anymore, he still grew up with a Cuban cuture."
