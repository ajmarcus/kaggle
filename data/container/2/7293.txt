"This memior created a warm, touching mood while he explained his childhood. I espicially think the part when he said ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and  endless celebrations that encomposed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"", because it shows an overall perspective on a normal day during his childhood. Also, where he states that family ""has nothing to do with being a blood relative really makes his memior interesting because it is also teaching lessions.All in all, this memior was great, and the warming mood is something that I won't forget, and I hope that I too too can write a memior such as heart-warming and interesting as this one."
