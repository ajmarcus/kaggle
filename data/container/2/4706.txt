"Where cyclist was gave him more disadvantages, then advantages. The advantages were their were hills to go down. Disadvantages hills to go up, water running out when he is in the middle of no where, very hot out, and is lost in the desert, doesn’t have much hope until he see's the factory. Biggest disadvantage is he is on a bike, and not in a car. So he has no @CAPS1 and has to pedel to keep going. But being in the desert on a bike with no water, and you are last, is quite bad. He is very lucky that he made it up the hill or else he would’ve died out there. And he thought he was seeing things good thing he checked it out. I think for future refrence ride in a car, don’t use a bike in the desert, its not to smart."
