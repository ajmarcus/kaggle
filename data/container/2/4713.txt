"The features of the setting make the ride for the cyclist very hard. It has a lot of hills, which would make him use more energy. Also, it is a desert, so it is very hot and dry. This makes the author need more water than he normally would. The author said I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. The author knew that it was very dangerous to travel there without water, he said I could drop from heatstroke If the setting had been cooler there would not be so much danger."
