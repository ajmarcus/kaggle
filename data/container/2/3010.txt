"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building were quite aparent. One obstacle was that of nature, winds atop the building were at high speeds and always changing, this would make the dirigible unstable and difficult to dock. Another obstacle they faced was that of the passangers and bystanders safety. The dirigible could become uncontrollable putting many lives in danger. The last obstacle the builders faced was that of a law against flying airships too low over urban areas, it would make it illegal for a dirigible to dock on the Empire State building. The many obstacles that the builders faced blocked the completion of having a dirigible dock atop the Empire State building."
