"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because where he is riding it is very dry and hot. He can deal with the heat with his good water supply, but when it runs out he begins to get disoriented. For example in the text he writes Òover one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirrage,Ó That statement shows that the cyclist was hot, and the images around him making him feel more hot than what he is, and his lack of water made him almost belive that he was imagining seeing a building. Another example is ÒA sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hang my head.Ó This quote shows that the cyclist is in complete despair as he looks at the photo and hangs his head. This shows that the cyclist was constantly being reminded how hot and thirsty he was everywhere he would  go and he couldn't get a drink. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist."
