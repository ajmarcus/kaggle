"The cyclist was eager to get to Yosemite park he listened to the “old timers who haven’t left the confines of thier porches since Carter was in office”. He went the way the old men told him to take. He went down a hill in to town which was empty into a hard road & snakes in his way then up a hill then went down the hill saw a abanded “Welch’s Grape Juice Factory”. Then he saw a sign say “Gary And Wilber’s FISH CAMP-IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE’RE YOUR BEST BET!”. So then he runs into the bathroom & drinks from the sink. Before he got there he was getting thirsty & tired & when he saw the abanded building he saw a young boy drinking a juice he wiped his eyes to see if he wasn’t seen a mirage. So then he sticks a few pebbles into his mouth. It read that sucking on stones help take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate. Then he left then a stone went his throat. His troubles, thirst, & fear were all behind him when he saw that sign."
