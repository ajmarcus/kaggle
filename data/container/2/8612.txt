"The mood created by the author was structured around many things. First of all, it is a light, warm, happy mood as the author describes how he grew up in a simple but loving neighborhood. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" It continues to be a friendly, cheerful mood throughout the whole memoir. It grows grateful and thankful, however, as the author describes how ""They [his parents] came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even if it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" @CAPS1 he sets a mood which fluctuates and changes throughout the memoir. It moves from warm and fuzzy to thankful and back again."
