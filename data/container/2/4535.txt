"In the short story, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting plays an extremely important role. The story takes place in sunny California, where the cyclist was pedaling around 12 mph. the heat made his dehydration situation much worse.  “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” The cyclist was losing hope, yet he was still determined to find water. This setting was very important to the story, for if it had taken place at @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3, it would not have made sence. The setting contributes to the story by raising the intensity of the situation."
