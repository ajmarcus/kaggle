"The mood that was created by the author in the memoir was happiness, love, unity, and satisfaction. These words describe the mood because in the memoir the author would talk about how eternally greatful he is for his family. He talked about the struggles they had but how they saw past them and realized that as long as they have each other thats all that matters. They got along great and were very happy they had each other. They also helped other people in need which seemed to complete their lives. They saw everyone as family and as little as they had, all they wanted was to give back. That was the mood created by the author. "
