"I believe that this was a good ending to the story. When Saeng says When they come back she is talking about the flowers. When the come back alive. In the spring shows when the flower will come back. When the snows melt and the geese return she is saying that after winter (when the snows melts) and when the geese return(in spring). And this Hibiscus is budding She is saying when the flowers blume again in the spring.  Then I will take the test again,"" she is saying after all this happens she will retake the test (in the spring). This shows that Saeng will be watching at all these things happening and count down till spring again, so she can retake the test. She is ready for spring to be here, so that she can study and pass the test, and work at the flower @CAPS1. This will be her goal for the winter, till spring comes!"
