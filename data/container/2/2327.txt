"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The thousand foot dirigible on top the Empire state building could add stress to the building's frame. The stress from the Dirigible was way too much to carry, and the frame of the building would have to have been modified and strengthened to be able to hold the dirigible. There were many risks taken by landing a dirigible atop the empire state building."
