"The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One way is that the rolling hills @MONTH1 let the rider get more tired. Another way is that of water from severe heat. And finally the path you take along the way and how many stops you make along the way. The heat, lack of water, rolling hills, and the advice you get can result badly by affecting the outcome. A rider should make a plan and use determination to get to where they need to go."
