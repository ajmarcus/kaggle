"The setting affected the cyclist mood in the story. The cyclist was riding rough terrain and rolling hills. This made the cyclist feel like his journey was hopeless. When the cyclist arrived at the abandoned @CAPS1 Grape Factory he felt on twist of many. He was extremely thirsty and there used to be a @ORGANIZATION1 build there when the cyclist was a the fock in the road, he thought he could get some water. When this failed the cyclist was even less determined. He felt like the world was against him."
