"The mood created by the author in the memoir is, happy, proud of his parents and proud to be a Cuban. For example in paragraph @NUM1 he states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" His parents gave up their wonderful jobs in Cuba and now are working jobs that they don't like. Another example is in paragraph @NUM2 Narciso says that this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with a blood relative. Narciso is grateful for his parents and grateful for being in @LOCATION1."
