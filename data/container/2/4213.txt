"Blazing tempitures, lack of water, dwinding hope-all are the parts of the setting that affect the cyclist. Blazing tempitures, because the hotter the water was the more perspiration and lack of hydration was appointment you cant put anything back in your skin and your body cant function without water finally dwinding . Hope, the cyclist didnt think he was going to live through this. He tried hard and pushed himself and success was made. He lived."
