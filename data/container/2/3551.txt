"The architects building the Empire State Building incountered a big problem when trying to put the mooring mast on the very top. The second sentence in paragraph @CAPS1 states, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" Although the architects faced many problems this was the biggest. This ment that they would have to change the buildings structure in order to make it work. It says in the bottom of paragraph @CAPS1 that over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made."
