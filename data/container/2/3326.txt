"As the builder's dream for the Empire State building grew larger, so did the modifications they needed to make. To begin, they needed to research and engineer a safe and practical way for the dirigible to dock. This was soon done with the help of navy and government research. The next struggle was the structure of the building. Adding a mast with the added weight of the dirigibles and an engine room at the top of the sky scraper would effect the frame. In order for the building to be structurely sound, the frame was modified to withstand the added stress. Even with research and modifications, the docking system was never put in place. The strong and shifting winds above the Empire State Building would not allow for a blimp to actually dock safely, and so the idea was soon let go. Safety and wind were the two challenges that the builders could not over come."
