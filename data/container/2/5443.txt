"Confidence, persistance, memories  all things that Saeng has that helps explain why the author concludes this story with this paragraph since Saeng moved from her own country, she has not been very happy, she was upset pretty much the whole time and misses everyone and @CAPS1 from Vietnam; @CAPS1 she sees reminds her of it, that last paragraph, where it says, then I will take that test again, shows that she has confidence in herself and wants to try harder next time. She shows persistence when she says she will try again and hopefully, she wont give up, Saeng misses almost @CAPS1 from Vietnam, even the food. She also misses her family and how they look and dress. Her memories were probably hold her back from concentrating hard on her drivers test, she knows she wanted to do good so she bought the flower in hopes that would make her feel better. Hopefully, Saengs life will get better in the United states and she will learn to love this country."
