"In the story, Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, The @CAPS1 created by the @CAPS2 in the memoir was a very soft @CAPS1 because they are all greatfull for what being going on with their lifes like the @CAPS2 said in paragraph @NUM1 ""It was in this simple house tha my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feas (Albeit a frugal Cuban feas) always filled the air with not Just scent an music but life and love. it was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house towards gracious neighborhood or the many things I learne there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turn the simple house into a home."
