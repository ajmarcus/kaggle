"The life @PERSON1 lived as a child was a paradise in his eyes. He learned what a family really was, people who cares for eachother no matter what. And in his eyes, his whole community was one big family. His parents were kind, giving and generous to everyone. Despite the different customs elsewhere, all of these cultures were united as one family. They would lend a hand for anyone who needed it, because they know that they'd do the same for them. Throughout his life, he'd never forget his wonderful childhood and all the things he was taught, @CAPS1 and Generosity."
