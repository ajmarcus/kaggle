The reason the author of Winter hibiscus ends the story with the last paragraph is to give hope to the end. It gives a certain lift of joy at the end  of a moderatly depressing story. It just goes to show that if you care enough you can keep moving foreward.  And that the end of your world comes when you make it so. That is why I think the author used such a powerful statement at the end.
