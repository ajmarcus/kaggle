"The mood that the author in the memoir has created is a soft happy and @CAPS1 mood. He trys to say how grateful and happy about his memoir. An example is ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their Rich culinary Skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am enternally gratefull)"" OR ""Passionate Cuban Music (Which I adore to this day). His mood is also saying that hes happy for what he has because he said that his parents are very couragous and he could of never did what they did. The authors mood is very grateful."
