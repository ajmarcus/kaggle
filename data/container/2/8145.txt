"The mood created by the author in the memoir is love and appreciation. Narciso appreciated all that his parents did for him. They gave up a home in Cuba for him, their job and even happiness. Love because they all loved each other alot family meant alot to the family. they said family is people who care for one another even if they are not blood related. it doesnt matter. It's about Love and careness."
