"The cyclist in this short story was greatly affected by the setting. He was riding in a desert which is very hot, with little civilization to help him. Also the rode that was driving on was not very smooth which gave him troubles. The wildlife also had an impact on him. He once went by a big snake that he cautiously had to ride around. Also he thought he was going to die and that the birds were going to pick him off. The desert itself was what really got to hm. Deserts don’t have much water which is what he needed and he couldn’t find a town to stop at, at least one with some people any way. So the setting in which the main character was riding had a huge effect on him."
