@PERSON1 is a short story about a boy who is very grateful & shows a lot of appriciation torwards his parents. He feels that he is at home even though he moved to @LOCATION1. In paragraph @NUM1 it said his parents created his new home to look like a cuban home he had back in cuba by putting cuban thing on the wall. I feel that in this short story he is very grateful because he said in paragraph @NUM2 he will never forget how his parents turned this simple house to a home. @PERSON1 is a very calm and happy short story.
