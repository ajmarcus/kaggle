"The features in the setting are not very good for the cyclist. Hes in California in June, and its very hot. Its pretty much a desert. When he stops for water, the pump he finds does not have any more water in it except for a few drops. Also, the few drops that he does get taste like battery acid. So this is not very good for the cyclist."
