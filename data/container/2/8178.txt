"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, it explains how your house can effect you as a child and when you grow up. The mood of this memoir to me is comforting. I think this because when the memoir said that he had plenty of relatives around, and freinds that probably made him feel comfortable. Also his parents were very welcoming and kind so you would probably feel comfortable because of that too. That is what I think the mood of the memoir is and why."
