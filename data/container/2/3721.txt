"The features of the setting have an affect on the cyclist. He is going on this bike ride through the deserts of california in June. This obviously is going to have an affect on him because it will be very fast. At one point he says, The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed. @CAPS1, the setting of having all these ghost towns was troubling to him because no one else was around and he was beggining to rum out of water.  The weather outside was starting to get to him, and he said, I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasnt a mirage When your petalling through the desert on a hot day it is going to have effects on you. If he was in a different setting this felling of despair would not be      in the story. That is how the setting affects the cyclist."
