"Based on the excerpt the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in atteptin to allow dirigible to dock there were the fallowings. One obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. The greater obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The dirigible couldn't do anything even if tethered it to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."
