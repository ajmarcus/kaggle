"The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. One feature would be the dryness of the land. He was pedaling for such a long time that he became dehydrated, yet there was not a drop of water for he did not know how long and he didn’t think he could make it that far. Another feature of the setting was the heat. He felt like he could not go on because the heat from the sun made him want to have a heat stroke. Clearly, the features of the setting did greatly impact the cyclist."
