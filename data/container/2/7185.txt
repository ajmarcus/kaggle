"The author created a mood in the memoir. The author creates the mood of friendliness. I know this because in the text it says ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solodalriy and friendship."" This means that even though there was segregation around them, their neighborhood was still friendly. All and all, the author created a mood in the memoir."
