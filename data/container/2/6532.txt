"The author concludes the story with that paragraph to show she is not giving up on her new home or forget her old one. She shows she isn’t giving up when she brings home the flower to plant. That also shows she will not forget her old home. Also when she says, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” That shows she is giving her new home another shot and isn’t giving up. Another example is when it says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” Here she is accepting the changes and giving her new home another chance. She is not giving up on it."
