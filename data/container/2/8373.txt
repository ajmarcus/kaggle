As stated ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 the story that is what is talked about. In the story he talks about being aroud ""family"" people who arent blood realative; just that can make a person happier @CAPS2 the memoir make the reader happier because the author is writing about happy memories he'll never forget. Although it was simple the author put a lot of deep emotions that were portrayed in the story, which made the story has a deeper mood."
