"Throughout the memoir Narciso Rodriguez the author creates many different moods. As a ready I got a large variaty of moods from the author. Such as sorrow for the family and what they went through, pitty for the children and how they watched their parents struggle for them, yet at the same time they benefited from watching because it made them stronger. Though throughout the memoir, among all the of the other moods that are potraid, there is the mood of eternal gratefulness. The fact that the parents went through so much just for their kids to have a better times and a promising future is beyond the relm of words. Words do not exist that can describe how amazing those parents are to do what they did. This is the mood, and moods, that are potraid in this memoir."
