"The main mood that is potrayed by the author is coziness or family, because his parents gave up everything and came to the United States so that Narciso could have a great childhood and he did. Narciso's parents turned a small apartment into a happy comforting place that people would go to for a happy reunion matter where they were from. The single force of staying over brought people together. That is how Narciso grew up with and with that was lucky and grateful."
