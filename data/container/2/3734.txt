"The features of the setting were very affective in the story @CAPS1t exceed @CAPS2 Speed Limit. It affected the cyclist because in one part of the setting it went to roling hills. Thats going to be hard to pedal a bike on. Another was the setting affected the cyclist is at one point tumbleweeds were in his way. If the gets caught on the bike it could have caused him to fall and it could harm him. Lastly, the road started getting rough up ahead which could be hard to ride over potholes and thugs like that. Therefore, the setting was affecting to the cyclist."
