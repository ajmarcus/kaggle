"The mood I think the author created in the memoir was love.The reason why I say love is because to me he cares about the his family and he also stayed with his family tradition and he care and follows them. He also loved being with his family. For example in paragraph @NUM1 in the article it say; ""I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to LOVE. I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home. and to me that shows Love thats why I think the author created Love as his mood in the memoir."
