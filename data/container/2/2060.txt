"There are always challenges when you are trying something inovative. There are obstacles like getting approval, gaining support and you also need to be structurally sound. Al Smith and the rest of these archetects faced all of these. During the 1920s dirigibles were supposed to be the future of travel. Al Smith wanted to be able to dock a dirigible on top of the Empire State building. Other than getting people to go along with the plan he had other problems. The wind is very violent at that altitude. Dirigibles were not supposed to fly that close to the city it is dangerous and some were highly flamable. In conclusion There were too many large obstacles to overcome."
