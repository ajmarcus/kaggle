"When the cyclist began his journey he was confident in succeeding. Throughout the story however, the cyclist endures many conflicts to his successs in his journey. The cyclist faced his first difificulty once he reached a small, abandoned town. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June (kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist realized he had not conserved his water and his water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips (kurmaskie @NUM1). On top of his water problem the heat was unbelievable. He was losing hydration from all the sweat, and he was losing it quickly. The cyclist was also dealing with the difficult roads. There were many things this cyclist endured through-out his journey, but he was determined to finish his trip and was filled with satisfaction once he overcame these hardships."
