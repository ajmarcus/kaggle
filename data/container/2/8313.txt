"The mood the author created in this memoir is very happy and relaxed. It is also very opening. It is opening because it says we let anyone we consider family stay over for however long period of time. They are very happy and relaxed because in paragraphs @NUM1 it seems like everyone is mellow, and greatful to be in this country. They are so happy to have decent jobs, and new lives. This is the mood the author swings into the story. The author did a great job fixing these into the story to make it flow very well."
