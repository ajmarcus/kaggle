"The author of this memoir creates a very calm mood. This article isn't anywhat exciting at all. All it is doing is explaining this child's life. This memoir, to me, was like taking a list of things and putting them into a full paper. The author did not create any kind of mood that interested me to keep reading of this topic. This memoir did however express a lot of feelings though. It expressed how grateful this kid was for his parents and his Cuban descent. Although this memoir had a calm (and slightly boring) mood, the author's ability to reveal information was very deep and insightful."
