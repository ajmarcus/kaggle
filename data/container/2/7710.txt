The author set a mood for this memoir. The mood he has set is love and kindness. The reason love and kindness is the mood because he says he loves his parents for self sacrifice so that he could grow up in the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2. The mood is of kindness too because he thinks his parents are kind for letting anyone into their door.
