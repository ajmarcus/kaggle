"The mood is @CAPS1 in many ways. First, the mood in this @CAPS2 is @CAPS1 as if he was happy to immigrant to the @LOCATION1 Also its @CAPS1 as sad, ""... Even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved"", another mood would be brave. For me these immigraters are brave because I would never want to leave behind my friends and especially my family. Another mood is greatful. ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" In conclution, these are many ways the mood is @CAPS1 in this @CAPS2."
