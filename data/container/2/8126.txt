"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy mood, that's sort of calming. The author explains how the house was very comfortable for him. Narsico explains how his parents were caring and selfless all the time. I think that creates a very calming are caring mood. Also in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" which again creates a caring mood."
