"The mood in the memoir is very happy. Narciso Rodriguez, the main character and young cuban boy, describes some hardships such as his ""parents not able to get the right jobs"" or ""facing cultural hardships."" @CAPS1 Narciso talks about all the good things that happened. Such as his friend and babysitter, Alegria, made him feel great, or how his parents gave him the love of cooking. One thing Narciso will never forget his parents love and sacrifice. His parents always allowed family members to come and stay. Sometimes just to help them get back on their feet. The mood in which the author includes in the memoir is described her Narciso Rodriguez."
