In this story the cyclist is going through a desert of California. This is a reason why he is very limited on water supply. It is really hot which would cause him to drink a lot more water. He had started his journey in the morning so that the sun wasn’t as hot as it would be in the middle of the day. Then it started to get a lot more sonny. So with the sun comes more heat. The rider says “The sun was beginning to beat down.” This would help the readers realize what time a day it was and how hot it was. This was in the morning so he didn’t realize it but as it got into the afternoon he realized it and started to get dehydrated.
