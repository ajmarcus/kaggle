"The setting desented in the story, Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit, would be a nightmare for any biker. This biker is riding in the middle of a desert on a summers day. The sweat dropping down him is just speeding up his dehydration. This is shown when the narration states, wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke (Kurmaskie). This show how hot the desert was, and how he could drop dead. The desert is also deserted with rolling tumbleweeds and giant snakes, as he passed abandoned towns and factories. The dangerousness for a biker in this area is very high. The biker was lucky to have made it out of those sorroundings alive."
