"There were a lot of obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For instance, they wanted to add more hight to the Empire State Building so it can be, ""equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation dream"" @PERSON1 said. Next, Al Smith wanted to add a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building so it can allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. ""Over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Then they, ""designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself."" Also, ""the rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at it's corners, of shiny aluminum, and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arms"". The roof had to be completed before the mask can take place. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of mooring mast was nature itself. In conclusion, those were the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
