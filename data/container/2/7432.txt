"The author of this memoir put a mood to it. The mood of this is very loving, because the parents gave everything to make their child's life easier. There is also a very friendly and caring feeling for because the article says how their neighborhood is mostly immigrants and that they are a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants extended their hands to people well in need. I would say all the moods in this memoir is loving, caring, friendship, and equality."
