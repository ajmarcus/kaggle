"The memoir's mood is a sense of happiness because its talking about a place where neighbors are like family and everyone is very close. Like how Sergio and @PERSON1 became his surrogate grandparents, when they were people who lived in the basement appartment. Alegria, his first friend normally ate dinner with them. The whole memoir is about how his parents showed him the meaning of family and to be open to friends and neighbors."
