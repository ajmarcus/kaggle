"The mood created by the memoir is very explicit. He shows that he loves where he is and he doesn't want to trade it for anything. He loves his neighborhood because for him it's like a ""melting pot"". There are @CAPS1, cubans and Spanish people living there. In paragraph @NUM1, the author explains how his parents house and doors are open to anyone who needs help getting back on their feet. The author also gives a sad mood at the memoir. In paragraph @NUM2, his parents lived in a one-room apartment hoping that one day, they can afford to live in a three-room apartment. That is the mood the author gives off in the memoir."
