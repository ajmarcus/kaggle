I feel like the mood in the memoir is being grateful for your family for many reasons.      My first reason is Narciso's parents came to @LOCATION1 from Cuba just to make sure that there kids will have a good life.       Another reason is his parents did hard labor and worked really hard to make he a good life. They also made there house feel like a home for their son.            There are alot of thing Narciso is grateful.
