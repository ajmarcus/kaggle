"The cyclist had to deal with some tough terrain throughout his ride. First, he was in the high deserts of California in June. @CAPS1 usually brings a picture to my mind of a very dry, hot place. The cyclist had trouble finding water he needed, and thought he might die of heatstroke in the conditions. Also, there were hills. The cyclist said he had to ride over one long, crippling hill. From my experiences as a cyclist, hills are the worst part, especially if youre thirsty. The climate in this story was very hot and dry, and the terrain was full of hills, so altogether, that would make one bad bike ride."
