"The dirigibles faced some problems when they tried to dock them. The frist reason would be that flying an airship that low over a urban area is against the law. Even though it is against the law they tried it anyways and faced more problems, such as, the winds. The one time that they tried they couldn't dock it because the winds are too strong."
