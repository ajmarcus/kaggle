"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a very upbeat happy one. This is because he uses the memoir to describ how happy and upbeat his house was as a child. He does this by saying ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This indicates a happy mood because the son is very happy that his parents love and sacrifice helped pave the road to his future. That is why the memoir has a happy mood."
