"The setting greatly affects the cyclist trying to get to Yosemite National Park. First of all, the cyclist says hes in Lodi, California on a gorgeous day in June. Its very hot in California in June, so the biker is affected by the weather because he could die of heatstroke. Also, he is in the middle of the desert , where he faces tumbleweeds crossing his path a large snake that are possible poisonous in the way. That puts him in more despair, because he could get hurt by a wild animal, or run out of water with no place to go get more ! So the setting mostly negatively affects the cyclist."
