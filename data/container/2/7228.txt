"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a mood, that is overall cheerful, warm, and happy. He does this through his word choice. ""passed on to me their rich culinary skills, and a love of cookig that is still with me today."" (par @NUM1). He decribes his parents cooking skills as ""rich"" and he describes his feelings toward cooking as positive. Another example of the mood he creates is how he describes his relationship with other people. ""all of these culture came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (par @NUM2). From this quote, you can tell that he has a very close relationship with all the people. Another example is when he says, ""always filled the air with not just scent and music, but life and love."" (par. @NUM3). You can feel the warmth of the room with the adjectives he uses. This is how the author creates the mood in the story."
