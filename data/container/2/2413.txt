"There were many obstacles the builders faced when trying to allow Dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One of the obstacles was nature. The winds at the top of the Empire State building were always shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around. Another obstacle builders faced was a law not allowing airships to fly too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ""ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach it."
