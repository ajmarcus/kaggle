"There were many features that affected the cyclist. One feature included the first ghost town that he come by. but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. This had to affect him a little because he knows now that the people who told him the shortcut havent peen out for awhile. Another feature that affected the cyclist was the lack of water in a ""desert in California in June."" The cyclist now knows that it might be awhile before he gets any more water. The hills also had an affect on the cyclist because he knew now he was going to have to work really hard to get into the next town, without drinking much water. The Welchs building also had an affect on him since it was abandoned and no drinks were left. In conclusion, the cyclist had to battle many features on his way to the National Park."
