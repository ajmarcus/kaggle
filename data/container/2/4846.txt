"In this story, the features of the setting heavily affect the cyclist. Certain features portray that this journey to Yosemite National Park was dreadful, but at the same time enjoyable. ""I would come to along this breeze jaunt."" The word breezy shows that the cyclist can enjoy riding the bike because there is a breeze. Another feature of the setting is very old and dirty. The water that the cyclist is drinking is drying his mouth out even more. A tar-like substance oozed out followed by brackish water feeling. This shows the dirtyness of the water. Also this setting shows the cyclist had to use all he had just to survive. It says working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. @CAPS1, the features portray sacrifice and bravely of the cyclist."
