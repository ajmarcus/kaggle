"The author concludes the story with this because the girl in the story is almost like the flower itself. Just as the flower will blossom, Saeng will take the test again, both receive a fresh start on things. Finishing the story this way left the reader feeling positive, it was a short ending but one with a lot of meaning.  ...and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. I think the last sentence is almost inspirational and it makes you want to start out fresh as well as Saeng."
