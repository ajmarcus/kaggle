The features of the setting effected the cyclist. The setting was a desert in California making it VERY hot outside. The hills were hard to climb and there were dangers all around such as poisonous snakes. Not just this was terrain hard to move around on but the path was thickest. Ò@CAPS1 weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.Ó This made it harder for the cyclist to reach his destination.
