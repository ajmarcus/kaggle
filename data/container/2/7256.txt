"The mood created by the author in the memoir was like hapeness and he had a lot of emotion. Because he really loves his mother, and father and his baby sister. There is lots of emotion because Narciso talks about how he lives were he lives and how long he lived in a one-room apartment. The hapeness part is When he says I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home that was realy a happy and sad memory."
