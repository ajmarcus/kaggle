"The mood of the author is very greatful. I know this because @CAPS1 keeps repeating, ""I am greatful for all my parents did."" @CAPS1 is also compationate. In paragraph @NUM1 @CAPS1 sais, ""It was here that I learned the real definition of 'family'."" and it continues ""I will never forget this house or gracious neighborhood."""
