"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in Rough Road Ahead by Joe Kurmaskie in a very profound way. While he is riding, he sees surrounding him no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. When he realizes his solitude when he is in a state of almost dehydration, he despairs. As a result of the seclution of the setting, having only seen One ramshackle shed in many miles, the cyclist almost looses hope. However, hope is renewed when he thinks of the cool pines and rushing rivers of @CAPS1. That is how the cyclist is affected by his setting, and despair is turned to hope."
