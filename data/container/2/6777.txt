"In Winter Hibiscus, by minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with this paragraph: When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is buddling , then I will take the test again, @CAPS1 author concludes the story in this way because it is somewhat of a cliffhanger. In the story, @CAPS2 is upset about failing her driving test and she has just moved from Vietnam to the united states and so she is a little homesick. She sees a familiar plant, and so she purchases it for nineteen dollars because it cheers her up ??? reminding being alike the plants in Vietnam. By ending the story like this, you know that Saeng hasnt given up and that she is going  to try and pass the drivers license test again. But what you dont know is the end result of whether she passes or not and so it is a cliffhaofer. That is why the author ended the story in this way."
