"The obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the winds on top of the Empire State Building. This is because in paragraph @NUM1 it states that ""the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This promblem would make the dirigibles Swivel around in the air. Another obstacle is that the dirigibles had is that it uses hydrogen and Helium which is highly flammable."
