"The mood created by the author in this memoir is both happy and uplifting but also sad. The examples of how it is happy are the way the author describes in paragraph @NUM1 how his parents were able to afford to move into a better and larger house, ""twenty-one-year-old @PERSON2 and twenty-seven-year-old Narciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, @NUM2-room apartment."" @CAPS1 example of the happiness is when he is describing the time when his parents were decorating the appartment to look like a traditional-cuban home, ""Within it's walls, my young parents created our traditional cuban home."" @CAPS1 example of happiness is when he describes his community of united and hard-working immigrants, ""In our neighborhood all of those cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" And the final example is when he mentions that lot's of his family and friends grace their kitchen table more times than not. The mood changes about halfway through the memoir in paragraph @NUM3 when it says, ""Even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and carrers in the country they loved."" This is when the parents are leaving Cuba and their families and friends to take on a life in @LOCATION1. @CAPS1 example of sadness is when it says ""The barriers to work were strong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved."" This means that the parents will have a much harder time finding jobs in @LOCATION1, and they might not get the pay they deserve. Those of the various moods set by the author in this memoir."
