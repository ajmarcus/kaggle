"The mood created for me in this memoin is a grateful, happy, and mostly thankful mood. I believe the mood is grateful because it is mentioned by the narrator many times like during the third paragraph where he mention how grateful he is to have parents who made good meals and taught him how to cook. Also he said he was grateful for being introduced to cuban music. I think this memoir also has a happy mood because although the hardships are mentioned it wasn't about how they struggled but how the concoured the hardships they faced when immigrating to @LOCATION1. Another way this memoir is happy is because he talks about how happy everyone is and how family makes a house turn into a home it just touches your heart and gives you a sence of happiness. I think this memoir is mostly thankful because this whole memoir to me feels like a thank you letter to the narator's parents. That is how the mood created in the memoir to me was grateful, happy, and mostly thankful."
