"In this memoir I think the mood is a warm and nice one.One example on how its warm is how he discribes the home. For example, it says in paragraph @NUM1. ""Within the walls, my young parents created a traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This is a warm mood because when you think of a kitchen you think of a warm room with sweet eromahs of delicious food in the oven.A reason why it is a nice mood is because all of the cultures got along and treated each other like family. For example, it says in paragraph @NUM2, ""All of theus cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" It is nice because there was alot of racism at that time and all the cultures overcame it together.The last reason why there is a warm and nice mood is how he apreciates what his parents have done. For example it says in paragraph @NUM3, ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever don."" This is saying that he is greatfull that his parents left Cuba to give him a better life.Thats why I think the mood of the memoir is warm and nice."
