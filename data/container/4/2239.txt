"The builders of the Empire States Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Paragraph fourteen said, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" @CAPS1 planning for the mast, builders did not account for the high winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The greatest reason the mooring mast of the Empire State Building never fulfilled its purpose was because of safety issues. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" On May 6, 1937, the German Zeppelin, Hindenburg, was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Owners of the Empire State Building than recognized that if the same incident was to take place in New York, more lives would be lost. Builders of the Empire State Building failed to recognize the dangers of the mooring mast."
