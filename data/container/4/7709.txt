"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author's mood was very loving and I could the grattitude and respect in his voice, especially when he talked about his parents. He said ""There is no way to express my grattitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how impotont family and friends are"". The author obviously is extremly thankful for the enviroment he had growing up as a child and @CAPS1 sure he feels very lucky to have had such a great, loving, childhood. I can tell he is very proud of his parents because they gave up everything to come to @LOCATION1 so their children could have better lives. The author reffered to them as selfless, and I would agree. The mood of the entire memoir is mostly shown in the last two sentences where the author says, ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That shows the caring, thoughtful tone the author had as he remembered fondly about his past."
