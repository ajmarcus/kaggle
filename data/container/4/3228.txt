"There were several major obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such problem was that, ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have been transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."". It cost over @MONEY1 to make the modifications nesescary to do this. Also, the, ""roof had to be completed before the framing of the mooring mast could take place."" @CAPS1, they did not solve several other obstacles. Forein dirigibles normally ""used hydrogen rather than helium..."" And this would cause vast damage if they crashed in ""a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" In addition, being so high, the dirigible could not be weighted down in the back and thus would swivll around the mast. There was also a law prohibiting ""airships flying too low over urban areas. In the end there were too many obstacles so the dirigible docking plan was scrapped."
