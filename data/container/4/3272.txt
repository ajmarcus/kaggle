"In the excerpt Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their. One obstacle was, many modifications had to be made to the buildings framework. the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted to buildings foundation. Another reason builders face many obstacles is, most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium. This would be very dangerous if a fire occured especilly in a highly populated area. Another reason is due to violent air currents the back of a dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast. As it says on page @NUM1, paragraph @NUM2 the dirigible would dangel above pedestrians on the street which isnt practical or safe. Lastly, an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas and it is illegal for dirigibles to tie up to the building or even approach the building. In conclusion builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their."
