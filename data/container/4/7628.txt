"What is a memoir? A memoir is of writing someone's own feelings and experiences during their life. This memoir by Narciso Rodriguez tells of her life in her simple home in Newark, New Jersey. Throughout the memoir Rodriguez sits a distinct mood of love and care, which she learned from her parents back in her childhood. The mood is mainly set by the memories of her environment, friends, and culture. All of these things are described by Rodriguez to make you feel the mood she expresses. The mood of love and care is incorporated into the memories of her childhood, beginning from the time she was born. Rodriguez begins to draw the mood in paragraph two by describing her home that was made into a traditional Cuban home by her parents. She describes the ""rich culinary skills... Passionate Cuban music... And the congregation of family and friends."" @CAPS1, she begins to describe the love of her friends and neighbors, who she felt, were family. Last, Rodriguez describes the influence her Cuban culture has had on her. She talks about how her parents helped others of their kind which made her what she is today."
