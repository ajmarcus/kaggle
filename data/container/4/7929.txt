"The mood in the memoir created by Narciso Rodriguez is hopeful, heart lifting, caring, grateful, lively, loving, and courageous. It's hopeful because Narciso's parents had to start their lives all over with any jobs they could find and they wouldn't have made it without hope. They had hope in their children when they came to @LOCATION1 to have great and prosperous lives. It's also heart lifting because it was about how their parents came to @LOCATION1 for their kids and they ended up successful in life and became someone. Having people for dinner, housing others in need, and always ready for more to come who fell down in their lives and need some comfort shows as much care as a parent is to their newborn. Narciso's parents showed him what family, and friends are and to have courage and persevere. He is very grateful of his parents for these important lessons of life: They didn't just tell him, they showed him through their lives which makes it much more effective. They always had life in their home because of the music and aromas in the air and all of the people that came for dinner or to stay for a short time. His parents must have had courage to throw away their life's work, come to @LOCATION1 for better lives for their children, and to start a new career. The mood was very important to really feel the message of the memoir."
