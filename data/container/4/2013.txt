"While the construction of the Empire State Building was in progress, the builders faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. At first, people thought it was going to be wonderful and lead to the ""transportation of the future"". One obstacle the builders faced was the fact that a large dirigible moored to the roof would have negative effects on the building's frame. ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". The builders would have to pay @MONEY1 to fix this problem. Another problem that was present was also the lack of safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Also, even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the violent winds would cause the back of the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Even if the back of the dirigibles were weighted down with lead, it would not be safe; as the lead would be ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" There was also a law stating that airships could not fly too low above urban areas. Nature itself presented many more problems, such as winds blowing the dirigible onto the ""sharp spires of other buildings."" As numerous problems became apparent after the building was finished, the idea of dirigibles being the ""future of transportation"" was dropped."
