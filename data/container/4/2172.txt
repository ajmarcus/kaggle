"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a multitude of obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was nature itself. According to the text, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The wind would make it difficult for the dirigible to get close enough to the mooring mast to get tied up, and even after it is tied up the wind would cause it to keep moving around the mooring mast making it impossible for passengers to exit. Another obstacle in the way of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building is a pre-existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In the text it states, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area,"". This is a very black and white problem against allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. A final, and perhaps greatest obstacle against allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building is safety. In the excerpt it states, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This creates safety hazards not only passengers and employee's of the dirigible but also the densely populated area below, that is downtown New York."
