"     In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, he included many stories about his ""family"" and parents. The stories, along with the parentheses expressing more of his opinion, created three main moods in the memoir. The moods @PERSON2 created were happiness, humor, and kindness.     The mood of happiness is expressed when Narciso is talking about his friends in the community and family. At the table, when at least one of his extended family members joined him regularly, Narciso set a mood that was very happy. During those meals that him and his family had, they would often laugh.     Laughing and humor were another specific mood of Narciso's memoir. In the parentheses, Narciso put a personal touch of his experiences. For example, when talking about 'rich culinary skills', the parentheses said, 'and for which I am eternally grateful.' The extra information had a hint of humor and kindness.     Kindness is the third mood set by Narciso. He had a kind tone when talking about his parents, and how generous and loving they were. He also had a kind tone when talking about the friendship in his community. Friendships like, extending 'hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearily in need'.     In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir there were the tones of happiness, humor, and kindness. All three moods were involved, one way or another, with his most important thing, family."
