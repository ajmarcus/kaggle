"Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, building a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was hindered by many obstacles the builders had to face. Firstly, the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would hurt the building's frame. Builders fix this problem by making ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications... to the building's framework"" (page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM2). After the mast's construction, two more obstacles arose. Firstly, most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is very flammable. After the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, the builders realize the danger in letting that same accident happen in densely populated New York City. The mast's greatest obstacle was ""nature itself"". Since the winds on top of the building were away shifting due to air currents, the back of the dirigible would swivel around the mast. Builders thought of using lead weights to fix this problem, but dangling weights high above pedestrians on the street ""was neither practical nor safe"". The last and most obvious obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Though the builders and owners were able to overcome the first obstacle given from the construction of the mooring mast on the Empire state Building, future obstacles prevented the mooring mast from fulfilling its purpose."
