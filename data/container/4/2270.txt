"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building are faced with several obstacles on they attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they encountered was designing a mooring mast that could with hold the stress of the dirigible's load. In stanza @NUM1 the author writes, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" @CAPS1, the steel frame of the Empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to ameliorate this problem. Next, the greatest obstacle they faced was the strong winds on top of the building. In stanza @NUM2, it say, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This arrived as a huge problem as the architects could not weigh down the back of the ship because it could endanger pedestrians. Lastly, in stanza @NUM3 it states there is ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS1, it would be illegal for the dirigibles to tie up to the empire state building or even come close to the area. Due to these three obstacles the plan of using a mooring mast became an idea of the past."
