"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, the mood that is created by the author is love and sacrifice. In the memoir, the author shows love by not only showing the love between the child and the parents but by also showing the love throughout the community. The author shows sacrifice by showing what the parents had to give up in order for their child to have a better life. In the memoir, it talks a lot about the neighborhood, ""all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people."" This shows the closeness of the people in the neighborhood had and this represents the love as well. Sacrifice is shown by Narciso's parents. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This  shows what his parent left behind for him, representing sacrafice. At the end the author also mentions ""I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" This ties up the mood throughout the memoir. Love and sacrifice is the mood throughout the memoir that the author created."
