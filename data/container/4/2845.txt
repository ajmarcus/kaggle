"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that the architects faced was the stress the cable tether would put onto the building's foundation. In paragraph @NUM1, Lsted mentions, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" A very expensive problem to fix. Another challenge the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their was the lack of safety. Dirigibles from outside of the United States used Hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. In paragraph @NUM2 Lsted says, ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse [an] accident could [be] if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The number 1 obstacle builders faced was nature itself. The violent winds on top of the building were constantly shifting. In paragraph @NUM3 Lsted reasons. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This would be neither practical nor safe. The obstacles the builders faced were to egregious, so the idea had quietly disappeared"
