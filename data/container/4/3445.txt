"In this excerpt The Mooring Mast by, Marcia Amidon LŸsted, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstical was to make the building taller than the Chrysler Building, but they overcame that with the desion to add a top or a hat to the building. They then had to accomidate with the new situation that new modifications had to be done so that the dirigible would not add stress to the buildings frame, since the steel frame of the building could not with stand the load and wind pressure that would transmitt nearly @NUM1 feet below. The biggest obstacles that led to the fate of the mast was the fact of, since most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen which was very flammable, and they could not have any accidents taking place above downtown New York. Nature itself was the greatest obstacle though because, of the constant shifing winds. The dirigibles could be weighted down in the back with lead weights but with them dangling high above pedestrians on the street was not safe or practical. There was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These are the obsticals that builders faced in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building."
