"The mood created by the author in the memoir is love.                                                                                                         To start off, Narciso had so much love and appreciation for his parents decision to immigrate to @LOCATION1. In paragraph @NUM1 Narciso says, ""There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age.""

Next, the author also expresses how important family and friends are to Narciso.
