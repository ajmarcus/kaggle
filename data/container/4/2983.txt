"The obstacles the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the lack of land area, the currents of the wind, and the gas used to make dirigibles float.The lack of land area was a problem because ""...some [dirigibles] were as long as @NUM1 ft., The same length as four blocks in @ORGANIZATION2."" This could be a problem because in a densely populated area like New York, people could be in danger of having large objects flying to and fro, so close to the ground. It would also obscure light.                                                                                                          The wind currents were a factor because 102 floors above the ground, the wind would buffet large dirigibles around, which would be a danger to the buildings frame. ""...the wind pressure would have to be transmitted to the buildings foundation."" The final obstacle would be the gas used in many foreign dirigibles of the time, which was hydrogen, a highly flammable and dangerous gas to have in densely populated areas like @ORGANIZATION2. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in New Jersey, [they] realized how much worse the accident could have been in New York."""
