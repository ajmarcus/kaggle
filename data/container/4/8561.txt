"If I were to describe the mood created by the author in the memoir I would say it is positive and thankful. I am saying positive because he regards his childhood so respectfully and proudly; like how he describes his neighborhood as: ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" From this quote you can tell that the author held his community in the highest of regards, as family. I describe it as thankful because based on this exerpt, you can determine that the author was taught family morals, and was raised in a household rich in Cuban culture. This mood is seen by how he tells the story of how his parents made the house they live in into a home. The author learned the significance of his Cuban heritage, and the sacrifices his parents made to come to @LOCATION1, which in no words can he thank them enough for their selflessness."
