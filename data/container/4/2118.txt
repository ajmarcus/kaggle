"When the builders of the Empire State Building were in the process of building the docking station they ran into many @CAPS2. One of these @CAPS2 being the air currents at the top of the building. The dirigible would be unable to stay still and safely let off its passengers. Evidence to support this claim comes from the article itself when it says, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Another obstacle the builders faced was the law. This law prohibited airships from flying low in a populated area. Therefore an airship trying to dock at the Empire State Building would be breaking the law. This was explained in paragraph fifteen of the article when it said, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" @CAPS1, it became very dangerous to dock these dirigibles in a populated area or near a building because there was the threat of them bursting into flame. Such as the dirigible Hindenburg in 1937. The article explains that the builders realized this new threat, ""... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been..."" @CAPS2 plagued the construction of the docks."
