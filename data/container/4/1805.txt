"The builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's Foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred Feet below."" The winds current would cause the dirigible to drag the building with it because the wind current is very strong. The weight of the dirigible and the pressure of the wind may cause the building to collapse."" Al Smith realized that he was close to losing the title of the world's tallest building, and on December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire State Building would now reach the height of 1,250 Feet."" Al Smith didn't want to lose his title so he decides to to make the building taller. The taller the building gets the stronger the wind current will be the more it adds on the building."" Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" Dirigibles should land in wide open areas where there isn't anything to harm the blimp, citizens, and passengers. The gases that are used to @CAPS1 the dirigible to make it lighter than air are highly Flammable. These are some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State building had to @CAPS2."
