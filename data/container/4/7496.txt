"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives there is a mood of happyness created. There are several examples from the article that show happyness. The first example is ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their child a better life"". Narciso's parents left everything they had just to give their son a better life. This made him happy because he knew his parents loved him and would do anything for him. The second example is ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows he is very aware all his parents did for him and makes him truly happy knowing they care for him that much. The third and final example is ""It was here I learded the true definition of family."" Where he moved to his parents, siblings, and neighbors became his ""family"" and although he didn't know all of his ""real"" family he was happy with the one he had. Those three examples show the mood of the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez""."
