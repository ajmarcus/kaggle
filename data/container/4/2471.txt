"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the very important obstacles they had to face was the thousand-foot dirigible adding stress to the buildings frame. Therefore, ""... have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" (@NUM1) @CAPS1, the builders face the obstacle of safety. Dirigibles used hydrogen, ""... rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@NUM2. line @NUM3) The greatest obstacle faced by the builders was nature. As the winds were shifting at the top of the building, the back of the dirigibles swiveled around the mast. Previous solutions; ""dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights..."" (@NUM4. line @NUM3-5) were not safe with the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. Lastly, an obstacle they faced was that there was a ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@NUM6. line @NUM7) this made it so the dirigibles could not even approach this area. There were several obstacles faced when the builders were trying to make the Empire State building a docking station."
