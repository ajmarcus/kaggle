"In trying to build dock at the top of the Empire State Building for dirigibles, the workers faced many obstacles. One reason is because ""the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) because it would only be held by ""a single cable tether"" (@CAPS1. @NUM1) which would add stress to the building. And the only way to fix would be to spend ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications"" to strengthen it. Another obsticle was ""nature itself"" (@CAPS1. @NUM3). This is because the winds would be ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1. @NUM3). And the one way to solve it would be to put lead weights to weigh down the back, but its not ""practical nor safe."" (@CAPS1. @NUM3) The last reason why is because of the ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" so it would ""Make it illegal for a ship to ever tie to the building."""
