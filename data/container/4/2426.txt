"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obsticles and attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obsticle was the fact that dirigibles were dangerous when not handled correctly. If so, many people could die because it was within a densely populated area. In paragraph @NUM1, the author states, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" @CAPS1 was also an issue in allowing dirigibles to dock there; the wind at that height was very forcefull, and would become a problem. In paragraph @NUM2, the author states in relation to the wind, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another obsticle was the laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. Paragraph @NUM3 states, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even a produced area..."" @CAPS2, all of these obsticles made it impossible in the end for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
