"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were all due to the addition of the mooring mast. First, the architects had to modify the steel frame of the Empire state building. The architects knew that the large mooring mass could not be simply placed on the building flat roof. Marcia Amidon Lsted explains tha ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building frame"". (@CAPS1 @NUM1). Because, the building needed to adapt to the situation, they spent over @MONEY1 to modify the framework. Another obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building had to face were the safety issues of the new mooring mast. These concerns about the safety arrose from an incident when the Hindenburg, a German dirigible was destroyed by fir at Lakehurst, New Jersey. Because, the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium the risks were higher. Helium is more flammable. Lsted writes ""the owners of the Empire State realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (Lsted @NUM2). The Empire State Building was just an impractical location for an airship dock. Finally by the late 1930s it was certain that the mooring mass would not fulfill its purpose because dirigibles had now given way to airplanes."
