"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, it describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1 they described the greatest reason was one of the safety because most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.In paragraph @NUM2 they also describe another obstacle was the nature itself because the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Even dirigles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights, this could be dangerous for pedestrians. In paragraph @NUM3 they describe another reason why dirigles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. These are some examples of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles docking there."
