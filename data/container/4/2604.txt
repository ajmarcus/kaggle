"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1 building faced obstacles in attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that it would add stress to the building's frame. To accommodate the stress sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications, and strengthening would have to be done. Another obstacle was that dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is flammable. if something like the German Hindenburg being destroyed by fire was to happened in New York the consequences would be much worse. Also, the wind would be an obstacle as well. It would cause the back of the ship to swivel all around the mooring mast. One of the most overlooked obstacles was that of the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, and it was illegal for the ship to even tie up to the building. Clearly many obstacles to place in the attempts to allow dirigible to dock on the Empire State Building."
