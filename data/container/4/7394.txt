"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very warm with lots of love. The author explains how him growing up in his environment had showed him that ""family"" didn't necessarily mean blood relative. Everyone in his neighborhood came together in ""great solidarity and friendship."" Whatever family members had went to the authors home, his parents would take them in no matter what because they knew if they were in the same situation they would be welcomed also. So for that they always kept their arms and door wide open to people they considered family. The author also mentioned that he would always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice and how important family and friends are. So in conclusion, the mood was warm and loving because he learned the real meaning of ""family"" and how he learned about how to love."
