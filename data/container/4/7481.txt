"The mood created by the author Narciso Rodriguez in this memoir is special, loving but most prominantally gratitude.Time and time again the author shows his gratitude toward his parents for making life for him growing up special in a loving atmosphere. He describes how grateful he is for his parents cooking in paragraph @NUM1 when he says ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally greatful)."" In the same paragraph he mentions the music, ""Passionate Cuban Music (which I adored to this day) filled the air [...]"". His parents taught him to be open and loving to others as said in paragraph @NUM2 ""Countless extended family members came and went and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door opened to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This also taught him a sense of what family really is and that it has nothing to do with being a blood relative but a loving friendship and sense of respect and caring. I feel he best expresses his gratitude in paragraph @NUM3 when he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" and in paragraph @NUM4 and he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home.""
