"The author created a tone in the memoir that was truthful and grateful and pride inducing.  ""pasionate Cuban music... Filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations... that formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (@NUM1). The former quote was found in paragraph @NUM1 described the pride and gratefulness of the home in which the author lived. The memoir created a Family love which every person longs for in life. "" They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life"" (@NUM3). Anyone who can sacrifice like that for the better life of their family is a good person. That is the family love I am describing being selfless and loving to other members of your family. Another mood created in the memoir was pride in the family's sacrifice. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice I've often told them that what they did was a more courageous thing than I could have ever done"" (@NUM4). That was a quote from paragraph @NUM4. It shows that you have to be thankful for the sacrifices people make for you. All of which make the qualities of a good family life."
