"There were many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One problem that was addressed was the fact that dirigibles all over the world were mostly filled with hydrogen, which was flammable. This was a problem because on May 6, 1937 a dirigible was destroyed by fire and the owners of the Empire State building relized ""how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place of a densely populated area."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) Another potential problem were the strong wind currents on top of the building, as described in @CAPS1 @NUM2. The concern was that these strong currents would prevent a dirigible from docking, and could possibly blow it into another building. This could puncture the dirigible's material and cause a horrifying accident. The final obstacle that prevented dirigibles from docking on the Empire State Building was the fact that it was against the law. The law stated that ""airships flying to low over urban areas"" was prohibited. There were many obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking on the Empire State Building."
