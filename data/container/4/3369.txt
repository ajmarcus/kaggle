"In The Mooring @CAPS1 by Marcia Amidon Lsted, the builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. one of the main problems was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" which made it dangerous for dirigible to be turning around the building above pedestrians.Another obstacle that the builders raced was that the dirigibles used hydrogen, rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and the owners of the Empire State building did not want a dirigible to catch fire above a ""densely populated area such as downtown New York.""The last obstacle faced in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made ""it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."""
