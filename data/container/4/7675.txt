"In the memoir the author obviously seems to be grateful and thankful because he states it multiple times in the passage. When he is recalling all the memories he had it proves to be a warm and happy mood. The cookings skills that his parents passed on to him he says that he's grateful for and passionate Cuban music he says that he still adores to this day. The author also states that there's not only a sense of family in being a blood relative but in the neighborhood as well. All the different cultures of his neighborhood; Spanish, Cuban and Italian came together in a great solidarity and friendship. The author is so thankful in fact that he's actually told his parents that he could have never done something as courageous as they did. The mood of the memoir is so strong in a positive way because he also writes that there is no way for him to express his gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon him at such an early age. To wrap up his memoir he mentions that he will never forget how his parents turned a simple house into a home."
