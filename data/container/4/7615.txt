"The mood created by the author in this memoir of Narciso Rodriguez is grateful. Throughout the excerpt, it shows his gratefulness towards his life living with his family, his life in his home, and his overall life living in @LOCATION1. Reading this makes me feel grateful to live in @LOCATION1. It even mentions in the passage that he's ""grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" It uses words such as ""warm"", which here means friendly, ""aroma"", ""rich"", and ""solidarity"". All these words, and many other words close in meaning, set this mood. In the @NUM1 paragraph it mentions all the sacrifice that his parents took to get their family to @LOCATION1. And then it talks about his gratefulness, to truly show the contrast between sacrifice and the state of being grateful. Those are the reasons that point to the mood of this excerpt being grateful, or gratefulness."
