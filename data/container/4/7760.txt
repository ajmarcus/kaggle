"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the author does a great job creating the mood. One example of how the author creates the mood is, when the author says ""my parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" That creates a mood of happiness and love. That's because the author shows it by saying created our traditional Cuban home. Making the family feel back at home made them feel happy. Also the author makes the mood of the passage ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today. The author creates the mood as happy and gratefulness. The author shows it by saying love of cooking. Also by saying which is still with me today and I am grateful. Also in this memoir the mood is shown by gratefulness by the line, I will always be grateful to my parents. Lastly, the author creates a mood bravery and caring. It says ""my mother and father had come to this country with such courage."" That line shows they were brave and willing to try something new, they cared for their child. That is how the mood is created by the author."
