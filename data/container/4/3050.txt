"in the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lsted there were many obstacles that builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there One of the problems was that a huge dirigible held the top of the building held by a single cable would have stressed to the rest of the building. in order to make the tower half of the building more stable they would have to spend sixty thousand dollars on modifications @CAPS1 nature was a key issue the winds were unpredictable because of violent air currents and even if the dirigibles were tied to the mast, the back would swivel around @CAPS2 large dirigibles dangling above pedestrians was not safe. Another reason as to why dirigibles could not be docked at the top of the Empire State Building was because there was a law not allowing airships to fly so low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal to ever dock ships there. overall, these were some of the obstacles faced well building the Empire State Building"
