"The mood of the memoir is very warm, happy and inviting. Since the whole story portrays this mood, I will tell you some reasons why. In paragraph @NUM1, Rodriguez tells you how everybody in his neighborhood were good friends and would always give a hand to people in need. Paragraph @NUM2 goes into more detail about paragraph @NUM1, telling us how many of Rodriguez's neighbors, friends and relatives joined him and his family at dinner on a regular basis. His parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" In paragraph @NUM4, Rodriguez states how his parents selflessly came over to the @CAPS1.S.A to give him a better life. They give up everything they had just so he could have more than his parents did. This just goes to show how much Rodriguez's parents cared for him. As you can see, this is why the mood of the memoir is warm, happy, and inviting. (Also heart warming!)"
