"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the author created a happy tone throughout the whole story. Narcisco talked about how when he moved to @LOCATION1 he moved into a three-bedroom apartment. He brought with him the love of cooking. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love for cooking that is still with me today. Narciso was very grateful that his parents came to @LOCATION1 to help him make his home seem more like a traditional Cuban home. ""It was a simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"", and for that I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."""
