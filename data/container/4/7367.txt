"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very sad, loving, caring. @CAPS2 @NUM1 states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice; I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could of ever done."" @CAPS1 he is very respectful to his parents, thanks them for making a great life for him. Also in @CAPS2 @NUM1 states ""They showned me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" @CAPS1 whatever occurs you always go back to your roots. And how important family, and friends are. The real @CAPS1 of ""family"" through this kids eyes."
