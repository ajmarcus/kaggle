"In this excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez the author uses a large array of vocabulary and creates his sentences in such a way that one can easily register the author's mood of love, happiness, and appreciation of his home and community. ""For instance when he described the harmony and friendship within his neighborhood despite nationality, which was quite contradictory to the times ""In our neighborhood... all of these culture came together in Solidarity and friendship"". His word choice and constant repitition of words such as love, grateful, & self-less reinforce this image/atmosphere of love "" They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life"". ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. ""@CAPS1, the author's thoughtfully crafted and retrospective composition especially how vividly he describes it as a place so near & dear to him gives room to the mood of underlying gratitude & love."
