"The mood the author created in the memoir was appreciation. Narciso Rodriguez thank his parents many times for moving to @LOCATION1 and giving up their lives in Cuba to give him a better life. He also thanks them for his childhood. He thank them for teaching him so many things as a child and the environment he grew up in. When the author says how his parents cooking was passed on to him he cuts away from the article specifically to thank his parents. He tells how even though his community was made up of many races they still lived in friendship and unity. He tells how people always came over to house for dinner and there were many celebrations. He tells of the courage his mother and father had of coming to the country without any knowledge of the language or culture. He describes how all immigrants left their country just to give their children better lives. Narciso describes how his parents had great jobs in Cuba, gave those up, and took any jobs they could find in @LOCATION1. In paragraph six he says how he will always be greatful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. Also in that paragraph he says there is no way to express the graditude he feels towards his parents. The last sentence of that paragraph he says ""They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" There once again he is thanking his parents. Throughout the memoir he describes his parents like heroes and thanks them for everything they did for him. That is why the mood for this memoir was appreciation"
