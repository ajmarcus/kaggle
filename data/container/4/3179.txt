"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. The first obstacle was that the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified. The excerpt says, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Another obstacle was safety. After the German dirigible Hindenburg caught on fire, builders realized how bad the devastation would be if that happened over densely populated New York City. Nature was also a large obstacle. Shifting air currents at the top of the building would make the dirigible very unstable. It would be dangerous to have an unstable dirigible hanging above crowded city streets. Finally, at the time there was an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" These obstacles are were the architects of the Empire State Building from attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
