"In the excerpt ""The mooring mast"" by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles. Their goal was to build a moor on top of the building in order for dirigibles, or blimps, to dock. In the end they were not successful. One obstacle was ""lack of a suitable landing area."" Without this, the dock would not work. Another main obstacle is the safety reason. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly fammable."" They could easily catch on fire and harm many innocent people. Which leads to two other reasons. ""Nature itself."" That could easily start a fire with the wind. ""Existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The dirigibles could harm innocent people. Many other obstacles were found so this plan failed."
