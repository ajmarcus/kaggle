"While in the process of building the @ORGANIZATION1 encountered many obstacles. His first obstacle was the threat of title for worlds tallest building being taken away by the Chrysler Building. When the architect added a 185 foot spiral to the top of the building. Al Smith had to come up with an innovative way to add height to the building. This is when the idea of adding a mooring mast to the top of the building was composed and the real problems arose. When building this mooring mast, the docking of dirigibles would add intense stress to the framework of the building. ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. (paragraph @NUM1) ""The architecs would add @NUM2 dollers worth of modifications to the framework to allow it to be stable. After the building was able to accomodate dirigibles saftey issues would be encountered. First off, dirigibles are filled with hydrogen which is extremely flammable. After the disaster in New Jersey they did not want to take a chance. Next, with the wind above the building the air currents would cause violent shifts of the dirigibles. The addition of weights, used in other situations, was out of the question because they would be dangling high above pedestrians. Lastly their is an existing that airships cannot fly too low over urban areas. Which this would clearly violat. With all these obstacles to overcome the idea of docking dirigibles on this mast was shortly discarded."
