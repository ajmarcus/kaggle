"In Narciso Rodriguez from: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author creates the mood of family and love in the memoir. @PERSON1 was a boy he lived with his parents in a three-room apartment. The heart of the house was the kitchen and that was where his parents taught him to cook and showed him the passionate Cuban music In the house, ""...the innocence of childhood the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both formed the backdrop to life in our warm home (@NUM1). Then, @PERSON1 realized that "" 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" (@NUM2), which showed that a neighborhood made up of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants could get along. Many people had lived at the Rodriguez house, even if they weren't blood related. Some people were the landlord and his daughter, who lived upstairs, while the grandparents lived in the basement. Anyone in the neighborhood was welcome to stay and they would usually stay in the house because they had an economic/money problem, @CAPS1 the Rodriguez family let people stay until they could get back on their feet @CAPS1, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us"" (@NUM3). ""It was in this simple house... where I learned the real definition of ""family."" And for this I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@NUM4)."
