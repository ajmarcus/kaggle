"By reading the passage ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon LŸsted it is easy to see the many complications with landing a dirigible on top of a 1,250 ft. building. For one there is the natural effect of wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" @CAPS1 winds would make it difficult to land any floating aircraft anywhere if the back wasn't able to be weighted down. Another obstacle the builders faced was that the frame had to be strong enough to hold a @NUM1 ft. long dirigible. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" The worker's then had to spend over @MONEY1 to remodel the framework of the Empire State Building. Another issue is that anchoring the blimps would be illegal. According to ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" All these safety troubles and violations would all together make the ""mooring"" an impossible feat."
