"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Building. One of the greatest reasons was saftey, most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is also highly flammable. Another obstacle that arose was nature, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would sway violently with the wind. Other dirigibles moored in open fields added lead wights on the back of them so they could not move. But there is no where for those weights to be attached to at the top of the Empire State Building. A practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building. Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempt to moor a dirigible"
