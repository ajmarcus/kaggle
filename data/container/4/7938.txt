"The mood that was creat by this author was love. It was love by how he discribed his house. ""The passionate cuban music fill the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Cooking and music you usally associate with love and love is happiness The author also talks about his ""close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants who extanded a hand to people who, not necessarily their own kind were clearly in need."" This also shows the mood in this memore is love, love of cooking of music and of family. Another place were it showed love in the memore was in this quote. ""My Parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This shows love because even though these people aren't blood related they still look out for each other and knew they had someone to lean on. The apparent mood in this story was love and the family had much of it."
