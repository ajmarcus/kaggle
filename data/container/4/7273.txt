"The @CAPS1 created by the author in this story is a couple different types of moods. One of those moods is a happy and good @CAPS1. One example of this is when the author states ""I Learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That shows a good @CAPS1 because it is about loving. Next example of a happy or good @CAPS1 is when the story states ""Countless extended family members came and whent-and there was often someone staying with us temperally until they were able to get back on there feet."" This shows a happy @CAPS1 because they are welcoming people into there family. Another @CAPS1 in the story is sad. One example is when it says ""Could not afford to move into a moddest three room appartment"" This is a sad @CAPS1 because a you always want the best of for people and if there to poor to afford a good place and that is sad. Also it says ""They struggled both personally and financially. This is a sad @CAPS1 because they are haveing trouble getting by. There is more then @NUM1 @CAPS1 in this story, but the most import @CAPS1 I think is loving. A example of loving is when it states ""all thes cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" That line right there is showing love. That is the most importand @CAPS1 to know in this story, loving."
