"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow drigibles to dock at the building. Drigibles are enormous steel framed balloons filled with hydrogen and helium maneuvered by the use of propellers and rudders. Al Smith wanted to add a mooring mast to the top of the building would let drigibles to anchor for several hours for refueling or service. But, the stress of the drigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be sent all the way to the buildings Foundation. This cost over @MONEY1 worth of modifications to be made to the framework. In May 6, 1937 when the Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey the builders realized how catastrofick it would have been taken place above the densely populated area of downtown New York. The winds at the top of the building would constantly shift due to harsh and violent air currents and the back of the ship would constantly swing around. Also, the existing law against airships flying too low over cities and urban areas would make drigibles not allowed to moor at the Empire State Building. All in all, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow drigibles to dock at the building."
