"Throughout this memoir a very important mood is portrayed and that is thankfulness. Throughout this memoir Narciso shows great thankfulness towards her parents and how they gave up everything in they country they loved, Cuba in order for their kids to have more opportunities and to have a better life. Also in this memoir it talked about her parents making the best of what they do have and always helping people in their communitie hoping that they would return the favor if needed. In their neighborhood all the races were together in unity despite the customs else where. In @LOCATION1 her parent's struggled both personally and finecially and they had to accept they might not get the jobs they deserve but they did it all for their kids, they had to endure the tough times for the better of their kids. Narciso has thanked his parents repeatedly for their love and sacrifice but in reality he says there is no way to express his gratitude. Narciso said he will never forget how his parents turned a simple house into a home. His parents perseverance is the basis of his life today that taught him great lessons."
