"In the excerpt from ""The @CAPS1 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS2, many obstacles are described from the construction of the Empire State Building in New York City. Thousands of dollars were spent on hopeless modifications to the building, in efforts to add a mooring mast to the top for the docking of dirigibles, or blimps. These efforts however were unsuccessful. Two main obstacles builders faced during construction were safety in nature. After a 1937 dirigible fire in New Jersey, owners of the Empire State Building ""...realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (@NUM1, @CAPS2) and an existing law forbade low airships in urban areas. Also, the unpredictable winds provided workers with a very risky, dangerous situation in the end, although builders faced many obstacles during construction, diribles were never docked on the building."
