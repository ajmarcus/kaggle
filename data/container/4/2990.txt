"The Mooring Mast On December 11, 1929, Al Smith released to the public the the Empire State Building would reach a towering 1,250 feet, the world's tallest building. To do this they were going to add a mooring mast to the top of the building to dock Dirigibles. The builders were unaware of the obstacles to come. They were faced with many architectural, @CAPS1 and nature based dilemmas. When designing the mast, they realized they could not just place the mast on top. The wind pressure mixed with all the stress of the dirigible being held by one cable would send the stress throughout the building, and even down to the foundation. (paragraph @NUM1) To do this it would cost over @NUM2$ to make the frame work strong enough to hold the stress. Another obstacle that came into play was @CAPS1. In the @LOCATION2 hydrogen is used to fuel the dirigibles. Hydrogen is highly flammable so if anything ever happened over downtown New York. It would be a catastrophe. The greatest obstacle was said to be nature itself. The violent air currents are unpredictible and the dirigible would be shifting around even if weighted down. But it is not practical or safe to weigh the balloon dow with pedestrians below. Overall the outcome of the mast was a fail due to the blindly seen and the blindly predicted obstacles of nature, architecture @CAPS1."
