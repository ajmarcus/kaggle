"The author of this memoir created a very uplifting mood. The way Narciso described her home, explained the sacrifice of her parents, and her definition of ""family"" all added to the overall mood. Narciso's description of her home and neighborhood expresses the passion she feels for it. She used phrases such as: ""I am eternally grateful"",""passionte Cuban-music, and ""which I adore to this day"" to express her positive feelings towards her childhood home. When the author ends paragraph two with ""life in our warm house"", the reader knows she was pleased with her childhood conditions. The sacrifices and selfless actions of Narciso's parents is purely uplifting. ""My mother and father came to this country with such courage... they came selflessly... to give their children a better life."" Their actions are touching and heroic - adding greatly to the up with the mood of the memoir. The author's definition of a ""family"" is very touching as well. She expresses that """"family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" and the way her neighborhood ""came together in great solidarity.""  @CAPS1 this neighborhood was united and supportive of one another - the kind of place that anyone would want to live. I believe that the last sentence displays the mood nicely, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.""  The perseverance of the author's parents, the descriptron of her home, and her definition of family all create an uplifting mood for this memoir."
