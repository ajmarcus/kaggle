"During the attemp in building a docking station for dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building there were many obstacles that made this idea less and less possible. One huge problem was due to the building's foundation. A swinging blimp, which can be up to a thousand feet in length, on top of the building would add a huge amount of stress. This meant extra money would need to be dumped into the strengthening of the foundation and framework, in order to support a huge zeppelin on the mooring mast. Since the building tops out at 1,250 feet in altitude, fierce air currents rip through the top of the building. This caused impossible docking conditions because the blimp could hit the building and pop. Due to the flammability of hydrogen this dangerous eruption could wreck havoc on the densely populated city below. Refering to the Hindenburg explosion in Lakehurst, @CAPS1 1937, ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if taken place above a densely populated area."" Due to the mainly safety reasons the Docking station for dirigibles was never built."
