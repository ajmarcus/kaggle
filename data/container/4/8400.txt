"The mood created by the author of this memoir is a mixture of a few different moods. The author is proud and grateful of his family, home, and culture which makes of every relaxed and peaceful mood. For example he calls his house a ""simple house"". He also talks a lot about family and all of the people he cares about. The author makes a very loving and caring mood by doing this. He talks about the love for the people and things in his life that he cares about. He says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" That sentence shows a very loving and caring mood because its showing that he really loves his parents for the sacrifice they made for him The last sentence in the memoir says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows a mixture of both mood. It shows the love for his parents for making their house a home. But it also is very peaceful and relaxed because it is showing that throughout the memoir the author had the same mood of not letting stuff get to him and being grateful for the things he has."
