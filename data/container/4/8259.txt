"The mood created by the author in this memoir would probably be gratefulness.     One way the mood is gratefulness is how much Narciso likes his culture. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This shows that he is grateful of his culture.       Another way is how much family he has that aren't really family. ""Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often then not. Also at the table were Sergio and Edelmira... My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary also... regularly joined our table."" This shows that he is grateful for all the extended family members he has.      Lastly would be how his parents cared for him. ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age..."" This shows that he is grateful for his parents teaching him how important family and friends are."
