"Allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building would have been completely different from anything before, but never continued because of obstacles. The builders faced issues such as safety issues, harnessing nature, and the law itself. The dirigibles presented safety issues including fire, which occurred and builders ""realized how much worse that accident could have been"" (¦ @NUM1) Another safety issue was keeping the blimps stabilized, which would have needed free hanging weights over the city. Yet another obstacle was the power of nature; it would have been nearly impossible to keep the dirigible in place. Because of the wind ""the back of the ship would swivel around... the mooring mast"" (¦ @NUM2). The new idea was a good one but the law also was against it, because of how low the blimp would be. As stated, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building..."" (¦ @NUM3). The masting moor of the Empire State Building caused too many obstacles for the project to be completed. Although it would have opened new doors for means of travel there were too many safety violation for it to be worth while."
