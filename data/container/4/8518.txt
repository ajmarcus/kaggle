"The mood created in The memoir was based off how The author felt about his ""home"" and ""family"". @CAPS1 was raised by parents that would let people stay in their house until they got back on their feet again, Their whole neighbor hood did it: ""Quite The contrary, [his] neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was The norm and segregation prevailed in the United States (paragraph @NUM1)"". @CAPS1 learned many diffrent things from them, like the definition of family: ""Growing up in The environment instilled in [him] a great sense That ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative (paragraph @NUM1)"". What @CAPS1 is trying to say that you can love Someone and call them your family even if they are not blood related. The feeling that @CAPS1 has towards his family is mutual to the feeling everyone else has with there's: ""[@CAPS1] will always be grateful to [his] parents for @CAPS2 love and sacrafice (paragraph @NUM3)"". @CAPS1 loves everyone who helped him through his life and @CAPS1 is grateful to have them. The mood in This memoir is love."
