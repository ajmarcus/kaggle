"There are a few ways to describe the mood the @CAPS2 created in this memoir. They description im going to give is the @CAPS2 created a very happy & loving mood. For example, in paragraph @NUM1. it say's ""Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" That means that family doesnt have to be blood related for you and that person to unite and became very good friends. Also another example is in paragraph @NUM2, where it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done."" That shows she's a very loving and caring person to actually be @CAPS1 for something your parents have done. Those are a few way's to describe how the @CAPS2 created this happy and loving mood."
