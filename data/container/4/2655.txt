"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first initial issue that they faced was the stress the blimp would put on the building As the article states here, ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation...the building would have to be modified and strengthened to  accomodate the situation."", the stress prompted the need for further improvements on the building itself; which obviously costs time and money. Another problem they faced was the impracticality of the dirigibles themselves. The dirigibles require hydrogen, which is highly flammable. As a result of the Hindenburg disaster, ""the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse that accident would have been over a densely populated area such as downtown @LOCATION1"" Another great issue that presented itself was the inconsistent violent air currents, which made safe docking for the blimps difficult. This problem could be combated with lead weights, but they ""were neither practical nor safe."" And lastly, there was already ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law prevented the blimps from being able to fly as low as the building, let alone land there. In conclusion, the builders of the mooring mast at the @CAPS1.S.B. faced many obstacles in its construction which questioned its safety and prevented it from being practical."
