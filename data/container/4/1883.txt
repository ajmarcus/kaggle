"The builders faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One was that they had find away that would not make the building to unstable ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" Another obstacles was the winds would be too strong and not safe for the dirigible to be up there ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" A third example would be that it was too dangerous to have the dirigible up there because the gases with in were extremely flamible ""most dirigibles from outside of the united states used Hydrogen... and Hydrogen is highly flammable."" The final obstacles the builders would have to face was that there is a law that does not allow airships to come to close to the ground in urban areas. So in conclution we can see that even though it was a good idea to port dirigible is was not a practical one."
