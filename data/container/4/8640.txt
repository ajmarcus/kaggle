"In the memoir, the mood seems to be happy, and grateful. To me it seems as if the author is trying to show his great love and respect for his parents and how they have taught him everything he knows and without them he would be nowhere.     ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice I've often told them that what they did was a much more courages thing thing than I could have ever done."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1)       This shows me that the author's mood is set to be happy and about love and how he is extremley grateful to have them in his life Also it shows his love for what his parents have taught him.     ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed onto me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.)     This also shows that the mood is in a happy mood because he is explaining everything great his parents have done for him."
