"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez the mood created by the author is that he is greatful and happy. Greatful is the mood of the memoir because he is greatful to have many things. First he is greatful for his parents because they always loved him. ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" (para. @NUM1). In the memoir @PERSON1 makes the mood greatful because he talks about how he is greatful for his friends, culture, and like I said before parents. ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent an music but life and love."" @CAPS1 of all he is greatful to his home and where he lives and whom he lives with. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" (para. @NUM2). He wrote all about how greatful he is for everything. So all in all, the mood of this memoir is that he is greatful and happy."
