"The mood created by the author in the memoir was happiness and gratitude.                                                            The mood was created from the words, and the way the auther described his home and his appreciation of what his parents did for him. @CAPS2 was born into a simple house in a blonde-brick building situated in the @CAPS1 section of Newark, New Jersey. The auther said, ""Within it's walls, my young parents created our traditional cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" @CAPS2 explained that his parents both shared cooking duties and passed on their culinary skills and love of cooking down to him. ""passionate cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.""                                                            The auther also explained how everyone in the community helped each other and treated each other like family. Even though his parents had no knowledge of the language or culture, they immigrated to make a better life for their children. They left everything behind them. Struggling financially and personally. @CAPS2 was eternally grateful for what they did.                                                                                                                                                                     In conclusion, the mood created by the auther was happiness of love and gratitude. ""I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned about how to love."
