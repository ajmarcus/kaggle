"The mood created by the @CAPS1 is friendship and love. When the @CAPS1's parents moved to the United States, They created a traditional home. The hard being the kitchen. ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" In the kitchen celebrations, childhood, Friends and family formed the backdrop to their life. The @CAPS1 learned that '""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative.' The neighborhood the @CAPS1 lived in is made up of many different cultures but they blend with each other to form a small comunity of honest, hard-working immigrants who help others when they themselves are in need. ""My parent's always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family."" The many immigrants gave up their lives in cuba to move to the US to make a better life for their children even though they did not know the language or culture. The @CAPS1 will always be thankful to her parents for that reason. There is no way to show her thanks for her parents love and sacrifice that they showed to her when she was just a child, and showing her the importance of family and friends. The @CAPS1 states ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" They didn't just change it, they did it through love and friendship."
