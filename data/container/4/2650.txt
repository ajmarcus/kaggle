"While constructing the mast to docs dirigibles to the Empire State Building, there were many obstacles that led to the end of this project. An inevitable obstacle was that most dirigibles were filled with extremely flamable hydrogen, that could be detrimental to the condensed New York City streets as well as the Empire State Building, if exploded. Also, wind on top of the building was out of there control, and with the violent wind currents, docking would be highly dangerous. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Although it would be possible to strap lead weights to the back end of the blimp, it would be unpractical and highly dangerous to the public. Dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building even if the docking station was completed because of an existing law that forbids airships flying too low over urban areas. ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear. The obstacles that stood before the Empire State Building's mast were to great to optimistically believe the project could be finished. It was postponed and became obsolete with the invention of airplanes."
