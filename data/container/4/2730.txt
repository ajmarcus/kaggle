"The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles such as weather, chemistry, and construction issues in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, the height of the building meant that, ""the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Due to the violent wind currents, the backs of the dirigibles would constantly orbit around the mast. Another problem that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the gases that most dirigibles were made of. Most of the dirigibles from outside the country were made out of the gas hydrogen: an incredibly flammable gas. This problem was exhibited by the German dirigible Hindenburg that was destroyed by a fire. With this misfortune, the owners of the Empire State building noticed ""how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as a downtown New York"". With this realization, the builders of the Empire State Building finally came to realize that a dirigible dangling high above the street was not safe or a practical idea. Lastly, the construction of the building itself posed a problem the obstacles of the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would put stress upon the frame of the building and would be incredibly expensive to modify. However, the builders fixed this problem at the cost of sixty thousand dollars. Unfortunately, the other problems with the construction were too great."
