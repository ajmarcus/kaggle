"The mood created by the author is one of blithe and thankfullness. The reasons that it is thankful if because of the frequent refrences made by the author to the courage and bravery shown by his parents. This is shown in @CAPS1 @NUM1 when the author said ""they came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and carrears in the country they loved"" This quote from @CAPS1 @NUM1 shows how grateful Narciso is of his parents leaving everything they had to make a better life for him. The last sentence of the memoir is ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" This is showing that the mood is Grateful because Narciso means that he's is thankful because they were able to turn their little house into a place of great friendships and great times. The last reason this article has a mood relative to thankfullness is shown in @CAPS1 @NUM3 when Narciso says ""But, in reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and a demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This sentence shows that no matter what Narciso does he can never repay his parents for their selflessness and care. The reason this article is also happy is shown in @CAPS1 @NUM4 when he talks of ""the endless celebrations"" or ""a love of cooking that is still with me today... ""This is showing the ""mood is happy and joyous because it is clear that as a boy the kitchen and cooking were a source of happiness and @CAPS2 in his home. These are reasons as to why the author has created memoir with a mood of happiness and gratefulness"
