"In a desperate attempt to revolutionize the way people traveled, the idea of the mooring was not thought over as well as it should have been. The number of problems and obstacles mounted higher and higher with the idea of mooring airships to a new mast atop the Empire State Building. One of these main obstacles was, while an airship was tethered to the building it would add stress, ""The stress of dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". Another obstacle faced with the mooring mast was one of safety. Dirigibles not from the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, which is Highly flammable. Another obstacle to the construction was nature itself, with high, shifting winds due to violent air currents, a dirigible tethered to the mast would swivel around and around the Empire State Building, the only way to prevent this would be to tie the lead weights to the rear end, but massive dangling weights, hanging over one thousand feet above the public, was not the safest idea. A last obstacle that was faced with the fact that there was an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas. These were all obstacles that should have been thought through and realized before construction for the Empire State building's mooring mast ever begin."
