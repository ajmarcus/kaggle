"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obsticles. In order for the dirigibles to anchor there, a mooring mast must be added. The architects then had to find a way to add ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building"" without adding stress to the buildings frame. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was the nature itself"". Architects knew that they could not control the weather, and this worried them. Another obsticle the builders faced was the ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". If dirigibles were able to reach the building something could go wrong. Builders ""feared that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area"". The obsticles the builders faced soon became pointless when ""the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared""."
