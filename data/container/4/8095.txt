"The author created a warm, loving mood throughout the memoir. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocense of childhood, the congregation of family and friends,... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This quote represents a warm mood because he talks about what he loves, such as Cuban music, and how friendship and family really come together to form his life growing up. ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This quote clearly represents a loving mood throughout the memoir because, like the first quote, it represents friendship and family. but also represents love and caring between all members of his childhood community, showing the reader that the community cares for each other, and they are all loving of each other. The mood changed near the end as well. It turned into totally love and warmth, but also happiness. ""It was a simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) this shows happiness because even though they are poor when they arrive in @LOCATION1, they are still celebrating the possibilities that are facing them."
