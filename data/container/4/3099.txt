"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles and attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first issue faced was that ""most of dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This was an issue because if the dirigible would catch fire or explode over it highly populated city like New York, many people would be put at risk of being injured or killed. The second issue the builders had to face was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These winds would cause the airship to swivel, even when tethered to the mooring mast, making it impossible to board. This would also be dangerous for anyone aboard the airship. The third issue was that there ""... was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" With New York City certainly being an urban area this law made it impossible for airships to even approach the Empire State Building to moor. Overall, there were many obstacles faced by builders in trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. Due to these reasons, the Empire State Building was never an effective place for dirigibles to dock."
