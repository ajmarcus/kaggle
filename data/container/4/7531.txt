"In the memoir, the mood created by the author is their feelings.In paragraph @NUM1, lines @NUM2, it says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, forms the backdrop to life in our warm home.""For that quote, the authors mood is sometimes sad and sometimes happy. The author's mood about being sometimes sad is because of how they live. The author's mood about feeling sometimes happy is because no matter what happens they still have their friends and family, or each other.In paragraph @NUM3, lines @NUM3 and @NUM5, it says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.""For that quote, the authors mood is srprised and thankful. The author's feeling is suprised because she would never think her parent would do that for her. The author's feeling is thanksful because thats what her parents did for her made her life better.All and all, that was the mood created by the author."
