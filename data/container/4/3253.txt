"On December 11, 1929, Al Smith, the four-term governor of New York, annanced that the Empire State Building would reach the height of 1,250 feet. At the time it would be the world's tallest building, but the builders faced obstacles with the more distinctive part; allowing dirigibles to dock there. First, it would be difficult to build a suitable landing area. As described in paragraph @NUM1 of the excerpt, a dirigible held by a single cable would add stress to the building's frame. Therefore, the steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened so that the added stress would be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation. Also, safety is a huge issue. In paragraph @NUM2, it stated that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The builders came to realize that if one of the dirigibles were to catch fire, like the German Hindenburg in New Jersey, it would cause huge problems due to the fact that New York is densely populated. Lastly, nature itself is an obstacle for the builders. The winds on top of the building are constantly shifting do to violent air current. As described in paragraph @NUM3, the back of the ship would swivle around and the lead weights would be dangerous for the pedestrians down below. Overall, the construction of the mast was difficult, and unfortunately is never to be used."
