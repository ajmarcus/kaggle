"The builders of the Empire State Building were challenged with significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One example, was the architects had to address the potential problem of the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law clearly would prohibit and make it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". Dirigibles were designed to be ""moored in open landing fields"" and ""could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe."" Another example, of an obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the potential risk to passengers and resident safety. The reason the landing of dirigibles were a potential threat to the entire population of New York City was that ""most dirigibles from outside United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The owners of the Empire State Building saw these potential risks ""when the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey."" Also, another obstacle of placing a mooring mast among one of the world's tallest buildings was ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Due to the unpredictable winds the dirigible could sway and ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"". The architects of the Empire State Building were threatened by the possible obstacles of constructing a mooring mast atop the building."
