"The builders of the empire state building face a lot of problems on trying to make a dock for dirigibles.  The builders could not just simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof.  They had to think about how the dirigible @LOCATION2 fair, they had to strengten the foundation of the building and a landing area for the dirigible.  Dirigibles were able to dock him by means of an electric winch The problem with this is they were in Downtown New York and New York city was a densely populated area.  A dirigible floating in the middle of a largely populated area would be very unsafe.  Also a dirigible is made of hydrogen and helium and hydrogen is very flammable.  So if an accident happens and a dirigible was destroyed, people below would be dead.  Another obstacle was the law, Airships cannot fly too low over urban areas.  The greatest obsticle of them all though was nature itself The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.  This idea sounded great at first, but too many things could go wrong."
