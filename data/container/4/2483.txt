"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock were very difficult. The builders had to modify and strengthen the building. The modifications were very expensive. ""Over sixty thousand dollars"". Another obstacle the builders faced were the winds on the top of the building. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast the back of the ship would swivel around. Also, They faced the safety. Builders were affraid that a @CAPS1 would happen because the dirigibles refill of hydrogen is very flammable. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" @CAPS2, Another reason was that the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it clear that the dock would never happen. Even though they were pretty high of the ground it was still effective. They couldnt even tied it up and secure it so it won't fall because it was still against the law This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."
