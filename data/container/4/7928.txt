"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, by Narciso Rodriguez the mood created by the author is gratitude. First, Narciso loved his parents and was very grateful for everything they did. Rodriguez says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice"" (@NUM1). Narciso's parents came to the US just for him and he is so grateful. Secondly, he says he has thanked them so many times but he doesn't know how. Rodriguez says, ""There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me"" (@NUM1). He is so thankful he doesn't even know how to put it in words @CAPS1, Narciso knows even though they only had a three  room apartment he knew it was special. Narciso states, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@NUM3). His parents couldnt give him much because they didn't have much money but it meant the world to him Clearly, the mood of this passage is gratitude"
