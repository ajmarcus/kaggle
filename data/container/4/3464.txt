"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems while trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the mask. One obstacle involved dropping ""A mooring mask on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (paragraph @NUM1). If they had done this, the mask would have added a great amount of stress to the building's foundation. As a result, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened but this was too costly. Another obstacle the use of hydrogen rather than helium in foreign dirigibles. Hydrogen is a highly flammable gas and if a dirigible had accidently caught on fire, a great amount of damage could be caused. However, the greatest obstacle involved the harsh wind current on top of the Empire State Building. Even if the dirigible was ""Tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around"" (paragraph @NUM2). The use of lead weights to anchor the dirigible down while ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe"" (paragraph @NUM2). In conclusion, while building the mast on the Empire State Building, the architects and builders faced many obstacles."
