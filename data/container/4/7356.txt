"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very soft and compassionate. The reason I would describe the mood as soft and compassionate is. When Narciso Rodriguez describes growing up with his parents and in cuba he never mentioned anything about what he hated about his family and about living in cuba. yet he describes all of what he loved about growing up as a child for example he says ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. This shows that just because your  not related by blood does'nt mean your not family. Another reason why I would describe the mood of the authour as soft in compassionate is at the end of the memoir Narciso Rodriguez says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.""In conclusion those are the ways why I would describe the mood created by the author as soft and compassionate.
