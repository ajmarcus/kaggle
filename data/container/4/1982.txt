"Various obstacles came up in this excerpt. This building of the mooring mast simply went from a dream to more of a way to win a record for the world's tallest building. The greatest obstacle they faced was the issue of safety. In paragraph @NUM1 it reads ""Most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" @CAPS1, an obstacle faced was the danger of the dirigible being destroyed by fire while trying to dock on the Empire State Building which would cause a large amount of destruction in New York. The builders, also faced the problem of nature itself. The violent air currents at these heights would cause the dirigible to swerve around the mooring mast. The builders also faced a legal issue stating in paragraph @NUM2 ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". @CAPS1, the dirigibles were never going to be allowed to fly so close to the Empire State Building anyway. These were the obstacles faced by the builders."
