"Builders of the Empire State Building faceD many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. When designing the mast, they didn't realize that the mast ""would add stress to the building's frame"" and in order to fix this problem, they would have to pay ""over sixty thousand Dollars' worth"" for modifications for the building's framework.      Another problem they encountereD, besides the fact that there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" ""the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting."" This did not allow dirigibles to be able to get close enough to dock, in fear that the ""wind would blow the dirigible onto sharp spires,"" which would damage the dirigible's shell.      An alternate problems faceD by builders was realized when the Hindenburg was destroyeD in New Jersey, due to the fact that ""hydrogen is extremely flammable."" They realized how unsafe it be to have an accident like that ""above a densely populateD area."" AnD so, builders were forceD to stop their work."
