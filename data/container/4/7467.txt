"In this @DATE1 from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"",Narciso Rodriguez creates a safe, calm and secure mood. His description of his home and family gives readers a feeling of warmth and happiness. The very last sentence in paragraph @NUM1 says  ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both, forms the backdrop to life in our warm house."" @CAPS1 just a backdrop. He also says ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close Ð knit community... ""and "" countless extended family members came and went... my parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family..."". The way, Narciso described his family and neighborhood, keeps you a sense of unity and comfort, like there will always be someone there if something goes wrong. In the @DATE1, Narciso creates a mood of gratitude, constantly repeating how thankful he is to his parents. He tries to get the message across that ""[he] will never forget how [they] turned the simple house into a home"" or ""their love and sacrifice."" In my opinion, Narciso Rodriguez created a comforting and grateful mood in his @DATE1. "
