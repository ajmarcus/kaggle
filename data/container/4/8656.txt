"There are alot of ways to describe the mood in this memoir, The mood created in the memoir is heartwarming.One example is in paragraph @NUM1, when Narciso Rodriguez is describing his house, he says, ""here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" @CAPS1 example is in paragraph @NUM2, when he says, ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative"". And again in paragraph @NUM2, he says, ""in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" And @CAPS1 in paragraph @NUM2, he says, ""it was a close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need. @CAPS1 example is in paragraph @NUM5, when he says, ""they (his parents) came selflessly, as many immagrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.In the memoir the mood that is created is heartwarming. Narciso Rodriguez's parents did a lot of this for him to make him feel like its Cuba. In my prospective this memoir is probably the most touching to my heart."
