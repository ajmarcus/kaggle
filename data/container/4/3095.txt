"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to dock dirigibles there. One of the obstacles they faced was safety, because the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (¦ @NUM1). If the dirigible burst into flames in New York, a lot of people would die. Another obstacle was nature itself. The winds were violent on top of the building. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (¦ @NUM2). This would have been very dangerous. A third obstacle was the law, which was impossible to get around. There ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (¦ @NUM3). Although this was broken twice, it was still illegal to dock dirigibles at that low height. As a cause of all these obstacles, the idea to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building was scrapped."
