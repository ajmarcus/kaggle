"The mood and Narciso Rodriguez's memoir was love and respect. Narciso loved his family so much, and he learned that family does not only include blood-relatives. Narciso's family included the friends that he had made living in his neighborhood. Majority of Narciso's love went to his parents. He loved them for selflessly coming to @LOCATION1 just to give him a better life. They were fueled by the fact that they were giving a great life to their son, despite the fact that their jobs were not the best. He loved them for sacrificing their home, family, and friends back in Cuba just for him. Most of all, he loved them for teaching him two very important things-the spirit of generosity, and how important family and friends are. His parents also taught him courage by not being afraid of coming to @LOCATION1. He constantly thanked his parents and told him that he wouldn't have been so brave. All of Narciso's undying love and gratitude piles up, and it is clear to see how much Narciso respected his parents."
