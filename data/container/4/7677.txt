"The author's mood was a very grateful and good mood throughout the memoir. The author loved everything about these memory's. For example, ""and a love of cooking that is still with me today (for which I am eternally gratefu)"". The author shows that he is in a good mood by saying he is eternally grateful. His mood was also very appreciative. For example, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind families..."". The author is very thankful and appreciative to his parents that came to the United States from Cuba just for him. He has thanked them many times. The author also shows his gratefulness again at the end of the passage. For example, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"". The authors parents bought a house that was big enough for his family and his mood was grateful due to his parents. Lastly, the authors mood was very thankful. For example, ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". The author shows that he learns family and is very thankful to his parents for that. That's how the authors mood was."
