"The author's mood was happy, thankful, greatful, caring, thoughtful. The mood was happy because he was sharing his life story and what his parents did for him and his siblings made him very happy and greatful. He is very thankful because his parents could have stayed in Cuba and let them grow up there. But instead they came to @LOCATION1 and struggled at first, but the end result was more they could have imagined. He described his parents to be very caring and always put their children before their needs. The author sounds like he is very thankful to grow up here than Cuba because he now sees that he had a much better life. Having a family liked he did he really cheriste the word family. At the end of the excerpt he said ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. This means it was just a random house when they moved in, but when they were done became a home."
