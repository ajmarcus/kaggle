"To start off, the builders of the Empire State Building had faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Many of the obstacles had delt with the dirigible itself. For example, the dirigible was highly unsafe and flammable by the 1930s. ""When the German dirigible was destroyed by fire, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937 realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area, such as downtown New York."" Another obstacle that the builders had faced was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. It would be highley dangerous for a dirigible to fly that close to a mooring mast with winds like that. Also, dirigibles could not fly near the Empire State Building, due to an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or approach the area. Al Smith's dream was to make the Empire State Building suitable for transportation, but sometimes dreams don't always go threw."
