"The builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In the beginning preparation., The builders thought it would be a great idea to let dirigibles (also known as blimps) to dock there. They didn't take into account the obstacles and struggles that they would soon face. The builder's didn't take into account the wind pressure and what the stress of the blimp's load would do to the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's Foundation, which was nearly eleven hundered feet below."" This was a huge problem the architects and over @MONEY1 worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. ""Safety was also another big issue."" Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If a fire had broken out over a highly populated area such as downtown New York, the results could have been disastrous. The winds also were problem. Even if the blimp was tied down to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swing around and could result in a dangerous accident. There was also laws against low flying ships. The architects For the Empire State Building should have thought it through."
