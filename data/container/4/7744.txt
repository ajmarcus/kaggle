"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" From Home: The Blueprints of Our lives the author created many moods. One mood was @CAPS1 and Friendship. @PERSON1's parents kept their arms open for anyone who needed help. so did every neighbor he hade. They all came together and had fun even when they had different backrounds. You hade to make as many Friends as you could to help you live a healthy life.          Another mood that was created was calm. In the house there was ""Passionate Cuban music"" and the air smelled of traditionally Cuban @CAPS2. This was because their family was Cuban so they wanted to keep traditions and make a better environment.             The last mood that their was was harsh and sacrifice. @PERSON1's Parents had to give up a lot like family, friends, job, and have just to move to @LOCATION1.  And when they got here they had to start fresh and take any jobs they could Find. His parents life was hard they tried to make it as good as they could For, their son. It was hard for them but they got by and did a great job."
