Back in his past, his parents shared all of their Cuban family recipes, they had a lot of family and friend celebrations with the rest of the neighbor hood, sharing friendship and helping others in need @CAPS1 as long as you can sea, the family and the neighbors all came together as one big family to be happy, to make a happy community, and that made the memoir happy. Another mood that was created by the author was sadness. At the end of the memoir, the author went back to the present, talking about the past times. At the end, he thanks his parents for everything. He talks about how he came around to learned the definition of family and how he learned to love. Because of this, the old memories seem to get further away, and the mood changes to sadness. The memories are growing old, but he will always remember his ""family""and his name. The author did a great job at creating those two moods and putting them into his memoir."
