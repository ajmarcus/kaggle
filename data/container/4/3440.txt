"The builders of the empire state building had many @CAPS1. One of these @CAPS1 was trying to get the frame of the building to support dirigible, ""The stress of dirigibles load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted to the frame."" Another problem faced by the builders was that there was a law against aircraft going that low, this was stated @CAPS2 @NUM1 ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas."" The biggest obstacle was nature itself. The violent winds that high up would have caused the dirigibles to be unable to moor, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mast."" These were the @CAPS1 the builders faced."
