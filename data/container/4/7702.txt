"The mood created by the author is very happy and grateful throughout the memoir. It is very interesting also, when he's talking about when his parents first bought the house and how happy they were in 1961 when they made their home into a traditional Cuban home, ""Within it's walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) In that @CAPS1 he also says how he got his culinary skills from his parents and that he was grateful for it. He also says, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their child a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) @CAPS3 you can tell a lot about his parents by those two sentences. @NUM3. They care about their children @NUM1.) They're not selfish @NUM5.) They're not afraid to make sacrifices and @NUM6.) They can adjust to new things and new surroundings. @CAPS3 by everything I have said the mood throughout the memoir was happy, kind, caring and many moods similar to those. The same moods came everyone that was mentioned in the memoir."
