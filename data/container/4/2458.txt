"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.  The first obstacle the builders faced was that the building itself would need to be modified.  The architects in charge of adding the mooring mast realized that if they were to add the mast as-is, and start mooring dirigibles to it, then there would be too much stress put on the empire state buildings frame.  For this reason they first had to make @MONEY1 worth of changes to the building in order to sufficiently strengthen it's frame (paragraph @NUM1).  The second obstacle which builders faced in trying to make it possible to more dirigibles to a mast on the empire state building was just general safety.  After the hindenburg disaster of 1937 took place, it became clear to the architect in charge of the project how truly catastrophic an accident like that would of been if it occurred over as highly populated a place as @CAPS1 (paragraph @NUM2).  It wasn't just possibility of catastrophic disaster which added to the worry about safety though.  Considering the constant violent wind gusts which happen at the height of the mast, architects realized that any dirigible moored up there would be constantly swinging rapidly around the mast.  The way this problem is solved when mooring dirigibles on ground is through the hanging of weights on it's back, yet this would present yet another safety issue because of the weight was to fall on the people below it could easily kill somebody (paragraph @NUM3).  The final obstacle architects faced was a law outlawing a dirigible flying so low near urban areas in the first place.  In the end, the fact that there was so many obstacles prevented the idea of mooring dirigibles there from ever becoming reality at all."
