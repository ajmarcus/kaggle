"In the memoir ""@PERSON1"" by @PERSON2, the mood is friendly. Anybody was allowed to stay at his house. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" His parents were ready to take anyone in because they knew they also would. Their community had a strong bond. ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" @CAPS1 in the neighborhood cared for each other even if they were a different race. Getting together all the time was life in his house. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. Getting with family and celebrating was the theme of their home. @CAPS1 loved and cared for each other in the neighborhood."
