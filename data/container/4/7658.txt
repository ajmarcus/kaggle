"Based on the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author created a mood. First of all in paragraph @NUM1 Narciso says ""here the innocent of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, endless celebrations... That formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This means that the author was trying to convey a happy sort of mood the setting that they were surrounded with me that the foundation to their warm spirited home as it said ""the backdrop life of our warm home."" @CAPS1 it also has a homey feeling. Second of all it also says ""family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This means that he felt he was close enough to everybody in his community it was like family. They were all each other had anything not matter where they came from. Finally, in paragraph @NUM2 Narciso says ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength, and perseverance, and thank them repeatedly for that."" This means that the author is trying to convey is thanks and gratitude on who his parents made him. In conclusion the author created in mood through this memoir that family has many different meanings."
