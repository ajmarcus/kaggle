"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their efforts to make it possible for dirigibles to dock on the mast. One problem was safety. Some dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which is, according to the article, ""highly flammable."" @CAPS1 a dirigible catch fire right over a very populated area would be dangerous. Nature was another factor. ""Violent air currents"" made it difficult to maneuver a dirigible and bring it close enough to the mast to dock. Yet even if these frustrating conditions were not extant, it would still have been impossible for a dirigible to moor on the mast, because it was illegal. A law prohibited ""airships [from] flying too low over urban areas,"" which included dirigibles. These obstacles were overlooked in the plans to create the Empire State Building."
