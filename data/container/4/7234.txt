"The author creates many woods in this memoir. Firstly, a mood that the author sets is warmth. Figuretive warmth. For example in paragraph @NUM1, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the back drop to life in our warm home."" which is a perfect description of some thing that makes you feel warm inside.Secondly, another mood the author sets is compassion because he talkes fondly and with compassion for his parents. As stated in paragraph @NUM2, ""My parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the knd of jobs they desurved... The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."" Which @CAPS1 very compationate and full of emotion.Lastly, a mood I think the author sets is acceptance, because his parent were so willing to take in people that werent always blood related. for example in paragraph @NUM3, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Which States that they were very welcoming and accepting people.These are the moods the author created in this memoir."
