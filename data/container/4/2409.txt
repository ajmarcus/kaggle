"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The excerpt ""The Mooring @CAPS1"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted explains some problems architect Al Smith experienced when constructing the world's tallest building in the 1920s. For example, ""The greasest issues was one of safety."" Safety was a major obstacle because most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If a dirigible was to explode high above this densely populated area many people would be killed or seriously injured. Another obstacle faced in this attempt was ""nature itself."" Nature was one of many major problems to allow a dirigible to dock. For example, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The winds would shift the ship and it would be very difficult to land on the mooring mast. The other practical problem builders faced was ""a law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The entire idea was eventually dropped by the late 1930s. Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the creation of ""The Mooring Mast."""
