"The way the author describes his family and his home gives the memoir a very warm, happy, and pleasant mood. He had a very warm tone when he talks about how much love there was in his house. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, and the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" The mood of the memoir was happy up lifting when he talked about how his parents helped others and they always had people in their house. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" The mood of the memoir was brought to life when the author described the rich culture in his home. ""traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen.... Unwittingly passed on to me they're rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" I think the addition in the parentheses make it light and airy. His tone is thrilled and thankful for his rich culture. The author's tone was very sweet, I think, when thanking his parents. ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me... and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.... and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" The mood of the memoir is warm, happy, and sweet, thanks to the author."
