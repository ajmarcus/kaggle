"The Empire State Building wanted to allow dirigibles to dock on top. To do this the would need to build a mast on top so that the dirigibles could hook on to and refuel. They ran into a lot of problem right off the bat and kept running into them. The first problem, of many, was that they could not just plop a mast on the top because it would be to unstable and cause to much stress to the structure. To prevent that what they ended up doing was modifying and strengthening the structure as a whole costing over sixty thousand dollars. Once they figured out how to equal out all of the wind pressure, they had to think of how to bring the dirigibles in, the answer was simple electrical winches. The next problem was safty, dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION1 used highly flammable hydrogen and if that blew up it would not be good for the densely populated city below. Another safety issue was nature's violently shifting winds and to solve the problem on the ground they would waive the back down with lead weights to keep it from sweying, but doing that in the air over a lot of people could be unsafe. The final nail in the coffin to this plan was that there is a law for bidding airships to fly too low over urban areas."
