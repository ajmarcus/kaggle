"During the construction of the dirigible dock at the Empire State Building, architects and builders were faced with many obstacles. Before the mooring mast was installed at the top of the building, it became evident that ""the stress of the dirigible's load... would have been transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"" (paragraph @NUM1). This meant that changes would need to be made in the framework in order to support the weight. In addition, safety, weather, and legal issues were at hand. Filled with flamable gas, there was always a risk of a dirigible catching fire, and in an urban area the damage would be extremely bad. Winds at the top of the building were also dangerous. Air currents were ""violent"" and ""even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around"" (paragraph @NUM2). Normally, the ships would be weighted down, but, again, this was not possible in a city. The last issue builders faced was the law ""against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). Although there was a law clearly against it, two dirigibles attempted to dock. Both attempts were failures and it became clear that the Empire State Building would not be able to serve as a dirigible landing."
