"In this memoir, the author creates a very unified and comforting, but also responsible and thoughtful, tone. Within the second paragraph, Narciso Rodriguez provided a sentence to generally describe his thoughts toward his three room apartment, claiming it to be where ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" The adjectives that Rodriguez providvedes in the sentence, such as ""innocence"" and ""warm"" provide for a comforting feel, while ""congregation"" adds to the concept of the unity. However, he is also shows that his parents were very responsible and hardworking, coming to the United States ""selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers"". With all this self sacrifice, Narciso Rodriguez himself expresses gratitude in great amounts towards his parents, constantly thanking them for the opportunities they provided for him."
