"The overall mood created by the author, Narciso Rodriguez, in the memoir is very warm, loving, and shows great unity at his old home and family. In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso talks about the great selflessness and courage that his parents had when they immigrated to @LOCATION2. Narciso talks about how grateful he is to them, for leaving their homeland so that he could have a better life. During the @NUM2 and @NUM3 paragraphs of the memoir, Narciso describes the warms and generosity of his family. He also showed how family doesn't necessarily mean a blood relative. His family came from Cuba, but there were also other cultures in their neighborhood such as @CAPS1, and also Spanish immigrants as well This loving and extremely rich cultural background that he had lived in as a child showed great unity between different types of people. Narciso's family's door was always open to anyone in need. Narciso Rodriguez's definition of family, shows that his background was full of sharing, joy, and love all squeezed into his small apartment in New Jersey."
