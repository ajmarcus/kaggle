"A sense of community, selflessness, and contentment washes over Narciso Rodriguez's memoir of his first home. Happiness was prevalent over this story, described through a ""love of cooking"", ""endless celebrations"", and ""friendship"". Readers can imagine the scenes depicted, happy gatherings around a table laden with aromatic food, and parties with people, young and old, tall and short, of all different cultures. The words that weave this well-written memoir are nothing if not content.Community is also emphasized in this written work. ""A close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants"", their neighborhood was described as. The memory of many souls working together despite radical racism in that time really gives the memoir a communal sense. Narciso Rodriguez says, ""My parents always kept their arms and the door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.""When the sacrifices that his parents made were outlined in the memoir, selflessness truly becomes a mood in the memoir. A whole new life embraced just so that their children could have a better life, his parents rarely did things for their own benefit. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" Narciso Rodriguez says. The endless struggles they endured, and the many times they could have given op, they didn't, because they wanted, so selflessly, to give Narciso a better life. This memoir's mood holds three important things: a love of community, happiness, and selflessness."
