"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were. The used of hydrogen rather than helium because hydrogen is highly flammable. The obstacles of it was nature itself. There's always strong and dangerous winds on top of the building. So it makes it possible for the dirigible to swivel around which is dangerous. Dirigibles moored in the open landing fields could be weighed down but, using these at the Empire State Building can dangling high above pedestrians which is not safe. Another reason is the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. If the dirigible blows the sharp spires of the building can puncture the dirigible's shell. These are the reasons and obstacles why its hard to attempt the dock of the dirigibles."
