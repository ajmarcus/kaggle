"The mood created by the author is happiness and gratefulness. Reading this made me feel very thankful. The author thanks his parents several times. He talks about how he learned how to cook from his parents and says ""and for which I am eternally grateful"" in paragraph @NUM1, and in paragraph @NUM2 ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice.""I think those specific quotes from the memoirs show how grateful the author is feeling. Reading this made me feel grateful for what I have, and think of all my parents did for me and sacrificed. I also think this sentence from paragraph @NUM3 supports the author wanting you to feel grateful. ""They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" I also think happy, because the author is looking back at his life and states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This made my mood become happy."
