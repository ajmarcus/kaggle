"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, the builders faced many obstacles when attempting to build the Empire State Building for use of dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that the architects and engineers faced was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium"" (@NUM1) this was very dangerous because hydrogen is highly flammable. Another obstacle that was faced was that ""the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@NUM2) even though the dirigible would be tied down to the mooring mast ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (@NUM2) Another problem due to the winds would be that ""the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell"" (@NUM4) A last example of an obstacle would be that there is a law stating that all ""airships flying too low over urban areas"" (@NUM4) was illegal. Even if there wasn't a law making it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (@NUM4) the attemption of even trying would be very dangerous to the people around and below it, and the building itself."
