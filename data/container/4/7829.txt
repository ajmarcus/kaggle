His parents sacrificed there careers and leave behind friends and family basically starting there life over for the benifit of their children.  Where Narciso lived was a nice two-family blond brick building. There she learnd cuban culture such as cooking and music that filted the house when she was a child. Narciso had tons of ""families."" Not necessarily blood related, their neighbors were mostly immagrants and when all thoes cultures came together there was great solidarity and friendship. She lived in a close community were helping hand was always there if needed. Her parents always kept their arms and their door open. Alegria their land lords daughter came down to their kitchen more often than not. Also her aunts Bertha and Juanita along with her cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary. Often someone would stay with them temporolly Even in hard times her parents would sacrifice anything for her And for that Narciso is greatful. Greatful to her parents for makeing a simple house into a home."
