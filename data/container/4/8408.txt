"The mood created by the author in this memoir is generosity. Narciso Rodriguez, the author, talks about how much generosity his parents had. He says, ""My parents always kept their arm and their doors open to the many people we considered family."" ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and carrers in the country they loved."" In the memoir Narciso says that he will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. His dad worked in a laboratory in Cuba and his mom had studied chemical engineering in Cuba. In the @CAPS1.S they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find. He says that this house was where I learned the real definition of family. He also says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS2 @CAPS3 parents were generous, grateful, brave and had courage. We should all be grateful for what aour parents sacrifice for us or had sacrificed."
