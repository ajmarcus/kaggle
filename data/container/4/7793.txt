"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood created by the author is a happy, joyous mood.The mood of the memoir is happy because of their close friendships. The family got along well, they cooked together, ate together and so on. The community was close, so everyone felt like family. They had feast with music. This are shown through the following quotes ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these culture came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community. My parents always kept their arms and door open to the many people we consider family, knowing they would do the same for us."" @CAPS1, their aunts, cousins, and friends graced to their table, and ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast filled the air with life, love, and music.The author ends it with ""It was here where I learned the definition of family. I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood where the many things I learned there about how to love."" That concludes why the mood is joyous."
