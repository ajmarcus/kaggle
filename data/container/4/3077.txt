"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were that the most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and the hydrogen is highly flammable. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area, for example downtown New York. The greatest obstacle was nature itself, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship with swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."
