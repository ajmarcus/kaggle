"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One clear obstacle was the law that had existed at the time making it against the law for airships to fly too low over urban areas. (paragraph @NUM1). Also, another obstacle in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was that most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable. For example on May 6, 1937 the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been it had taken place in downtown New York. (paragraph @NUM2). The greatest obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast (paragraph @NUM3). The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were too much to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast."
