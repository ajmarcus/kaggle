"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a mood for the story. The mood for his story is bittersweet. It is happy, but slightly sad. One way is is shown when @CAPS1 mentions his grand parents. Rodriguez writes ""Sergio and Edelmira, my surrogate grand parents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would not know my 'real' grand parents, Narciso the Elder and Consuelo, unil 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba)"" It @CAPS2 that it is bittersweet because even though Rodriguez had ""grandparents"", @CAPS1 didn't meet his actual grandparents until later on in his life.Another way Rodriguez makes the mood bittersweet is by talking about his parents. @CAPS1 writes, ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" It @CAPS2 that his parents sacrificed for him. Another way Rodriguez creates a bittersweet mood is by admiring his parents. Rodriguez writes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageas thing than I cold have ever done."" @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS1 is grateful for what they gave up so @CAPS1 cold have a good life. Rodriguez conveys the happy, yet sad times in the memoir."
