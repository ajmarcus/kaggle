"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: the Blueprints of Our Lives the author creates a mood of love and admiration. For example ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" shows the love the author had for all people. ""This environment"" is referring to seeing friends of the family (who are also immigrants) very frequently while racism was normal in the US. The author talks about the love and respect everyone had for each other in that community. Another example of the mood is ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" @CAPS1 the poem the author speaks of his parents with great admiration. I can tell that he is inspired by them. He makes the reader admire them too. All in all, the moods being created in the memoir were love because of the community he talked about and grew up in and admiration because of the way he wrote about his parents."
