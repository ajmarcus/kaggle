"The mood created by the author in this memoir is one of happiness, safety, and care. Narciso had parents who loved him and a very close-knit community. All the descriptions of his family cooking and family neighbors eating together is enough to make anyone feel happy. Throughout the memoir, Narciso emphasizes the care of his parents. You know Narciso's parents loved him as of his attitude toward them. In paragraph @NUM1, when he writes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" shows his parents' care for him. When the author writes, ""In our neighborhood,... all these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" These two sentences give the reader feelings of safety and once again emphasize care. This memoir by Narciso Rodriguez creates a mood of happiness, safety, and care."
