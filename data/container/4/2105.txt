"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle the builders faced was the harsh winds. The Empire State Building is so tall that the winds were very fast and it would constantly change direction due to violent air currents. This made it very hard to dock the Dirigibles. Also another obstacle was the pedestrians and other buildings around. Most ballons were filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable. If a dirigible got caught on fire or crashed, a lot of damage would be done to the city and its people. The structure of the building also proved to be an obstacle. The dirigibles were so large that the buildings structure was at danger of failing and destroying the building. The final obstacle the building faced was the law that made it illegal for a ship to ever tie to a building or even fly that low in an urban area. Although there were a few attempts, the Empire State Building never was able to have dirigibles to dock on it."
