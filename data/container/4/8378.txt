"The mood in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, is comfort. In chapter @NUM1 it talks about the overall feelings of love and care that surrounded the Rodriguez household like a comfy blanket. Also, it talks about how the ""... congregration of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompass both..."" helped pave the road for a great childhood with many friends and family members who where always there for Narciso Rodriguez to rely on. Another example of the comfort within the Rodriguez home is that the ""... parents always kept their arms and door open to many of the people... considered family, knowing that they would do the same..."" This portrays an overall image of a community where everyone got along and helped each other out. Last but not least Narciso's home was ""...always filled... (with) life and love."" Where he felt secure and cared for. All in all, the household that @PERSON2 lived in was a household filled with love, care and especially comfort that every child should have."
