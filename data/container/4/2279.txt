"While planning this architectural masterpiece, builders faced many obstacles. This plan to have a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building definitely did not fulfill expectations. The first big problem was the large amounts of stress to the framework of the building when the zepplins would be moored to the top, also the amount of pull would impact the foundation as well. The second problem was the cost to modify the skyscraper to meet the needs to not stress the framework. Safety was a huge issue as well; most blimps are filled with hydrogen which is a highly flammable gas, also if it were to explode it is floating over one of the largest cities in the country. With New @CAPS1 geographical positioning the wind is very strong off the ocean, these violent air currents constantly shift directions which could cause the zepplin to crash into the building. The final obstacle was the law against airships, they could not fly to low over highly populated urban cities."
