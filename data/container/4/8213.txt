"The mood Narciso Rodriguez creates in his memoir is a very good and bright. He and his parents survived hard times in their New Jersey home, such as segregation of @CAPS1-@CAPS2 like himself and not always having enough money. Yet he and his family survived because of the unity of his closely-knit community, Immigrants from @ORGANIZATION2, the @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, @LOCATION4, and elsewhere all came together and ignored their differences. They shared food, shared their homes, and shared happiness between them. There was a certain trust among the community, every family holding their door open for anybody,"" knowing that they would do the same for [them]."" (paragraph @NUM1) To make the mood of this excerpt very light and cheerful, Rodriguez uses words like, ""rich culinary skills and love of cooking,"" (¦ @NUM2) ""innocence of childhood,"" (¦ @NUM2), ""hard working"", (¦ @NUM4), ""courage,"" and ""selflessly,"" (¦ @NUM5) ""grateful... love and sacrifice,"" ""admiration for their strength and perseverance,"" ""spirit of generosity."" (¦ @NUM6). All of these words show that through solidarity, hope, and courage, people can make a good life for each other, no matter how hard their situation is at first."
