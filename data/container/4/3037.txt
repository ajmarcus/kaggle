"There were many obstacles builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they faced was that some dirigibles were @NUM1 feet long which was four blocks in New York City. This was an obstacle because it would add stress to the buildings' frame when it was attached by single tether. In order for this to happen the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be strengthened and modified. The next obstacle they faced was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. For example, in the excerpt it said that the U.S. navy dirigible Los @CAPS1 approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of the forceful winds. Also the captain could not even take his hands off the lever. The next obstacle they faced was the safety issue. The builders of said the dirigibles are weighted down by lead but if they did that it would be a safety issue. It would be a safety issue since the dirigible would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street. The last obstacle they faced was the law against flying to low over urban areas. It would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area."
