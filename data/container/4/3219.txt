"Builders of the Empire State building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A mooring mast, for docking drigibles, would add stress to the buildings frame and ""could not simply be dropped atop the Empire State Building. The building needed to be ""modified and strengthened"" to accommodate this situation. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen, which is extremely flamable. Owners of the building realized if an accident like the Hindenburg were to take place above a densely populated city or area such as downtown New York, results would have been far worst. Builders greatest obstacle would be nature itself. Winds atop the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the air ship could tether to the mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. In addition, due to an existing law against airships flying too low, dirigibles could not legally moor at the Empire State Building. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose."""
