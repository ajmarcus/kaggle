"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders encountered major obstacles. The first puzzle posed to the builders concerned the structure. They realized that, ""the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted... to the building's foundation."" This reality caused builders to spend over @MONEY1 modifying the building. Although the builders were able to rectify the framework of the building, the later obstacles were unable to be conquered. After the Hindenburg accident in 1937 ""the owners of the Empire @CAPS1 Building realized how much worse that accident could have been"" if the dirigible had exploded over New York City. The safety of the city became a concern. Until the blimps were less flammable, it wasn't plausible to take the risk of housing them in densely populated areas. The final obstacle of the success of the mooring mast was ""nature itself."" The violent winds that whipped around the 101st and 102nd floors would spin the dirigibles around the mooring mast. This was ""neither practical or safe."" Overall, the obstacles the builders faced proved to be fatal to the success of the mooring mast."
