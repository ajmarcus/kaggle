"In the article ""@PERSON1"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives the mood created by the author is both loving and appriciative. In the third paragraph, the author describes that the neighborhood, (mostly made up of Spanish, Cuban and Italian immagrants) would come together to help one another if they needed it, and how they could be like a family with out being blood related. In the fourth paragraph explains how extended family members could rely on eachother, because they know that they would do the samething if someone else was in need of help. Those are two examples of how the mood is loving. Another way the mood can be loving, and appriciative, is in paragraph five. Paragraph five shows that @PERSON1' parents would do anything to make their childrens lives better. in this case it was leaving friends, family, and work behind and moving to a totally different country. All in all the mood is given off as loving and appreciative even through the hard times of Narciso's life."
