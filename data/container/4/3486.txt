"In the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by @PERSON1, there were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.Their biggest concerne was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable""(Lsted, paragraph @NUM1).  The excerpt mentions the German dirigible, the Hindenburg which was destroyed in a fire. ""... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (Lsted, paragraph @NUM1).Another obstacle was nature itself.  ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (Lsted, paragraph @NUM3).  The unpredictable winds made it impossible to safely dock people onto and off the dirigibles.Finally, there were laws put in place restricting airships flying too low over populated areas.  ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (Lsted, paragraph @NUM4)."
