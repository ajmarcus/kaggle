"In this excerpt from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, @PERSON1  talks about the true meaning of ""family"" and the mood of gratitude is established.""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills... Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" In this passage, @PERSON2 is establishing his gratitude for the cultures of his family. He is grateful for the food and music that has wound its way into his present day life.My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" This quote explains how much @PERSON1's parents sacrificed for his happiness. They left behind everything and everyone they loved, basically a huge chunk of them, and for that, he is extremely grateful."
