"The mood creatd by the author in the memoir is a happy, loving, and thankful mood. Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. This is saying that there was a fun vibe in his house when he was growing up which makes you feel happy. ""Growing up in this environment it instilled in me a greate sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Here he is talking about the fact that he loves his family, even if he isn't a blood relative with them, that puts me in a loving mood. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" What he was saying was he was grateful to his parents for what they did for him so that makes me feel thankful for my parents. That was the mood I felt created by the author in the memoir."
