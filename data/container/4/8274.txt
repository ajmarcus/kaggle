"In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a heart-warming, and comforting mood for the readers. First, we see this comforting mood being established through the setting. ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home,"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This creatively loving setting gives the reader a sense of comfort when reading the piece. Next, we see this sense of heart-warming coming from Rodriguez's word choice. ""... there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age..."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). This rich, vivid word choice sets a caring mood through out the piece. Lastly, the family's background started out somewhat bitter, and depressing when Rodriguez explains their financial instability in @CAPS1 @NUM3, but then later on, we see the family moving to @LOCATION1, and finding comfort in their new home. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us,"" (@CAPS1 @NUM4). This sense of family contributes to the heart- warming mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in this memoir."
