"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, the fashion designer from Newark, New Jersey. Narciso talks about his Cuban family living in an apparpment with many other races. This presents a mood of happiness. The first way the mood presents happiness, is when @CAPS1 talks about his kitchen ""Passionate Cuban music, filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" (@NUM1) this shows that it was very happy and exciting in their kitchen. Another way is when @PERSON1 talks about his parents @CAPS2 ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice"" (@NUM2) This presents a happy mood because he is grateful for what his parents have done. Finally, the last way is when @PERSON1 concludes the memoir, ""warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a cuban feast alway filled the air, with not just the sent but life and love."" (@NUM3) This shows the happy times they had together. As you can see. The mood that is presented, is happiness"
