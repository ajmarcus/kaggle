"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir was very positive and warm, showing gratitude, and promoting the real definition of family. An example of his gratitude towards his parents is when he states: ""My Parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me the rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" Narciso describes his sense of true family in paragraph @NUM1 when he says: ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Narciso describes that his parents were very courageous coming to @LOCATION1 having no previous knowledge of the culture or language. He expresses how thankful he is for his parents to come to @LOCATION1, leaving everything they knew behind, in order to give him a better life. He describes his neighborhood being a true family, adding big dinners together, and helping one another in times of need ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done... I think them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The mood of the memoir truly does demonstrate the importance of family, love, warmth, and gratefulness."
