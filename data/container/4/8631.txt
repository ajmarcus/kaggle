"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a warm feeling. Narciso Rodriguez explains how thoughtful and selfless his family was. In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso reveals how cozy his surroundings were, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)... Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" Narciso further explains how kind and brave his parents were, ""my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved"" (paragraph @NUM2). Narciso tells us how much you both his parents and how grateful he is of them. In the end, Narciso expresses one last thank you to his parents, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" (paragraph @NUM3) All in all, the mood that the author created in this memoir is a very welcoming, heart-warming and inspiring."
