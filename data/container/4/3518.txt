"The builders of the Empire State Building were @CAPS1 with immediate problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The media hardship that they @CAPS1 was placing a mooring mast on top of an already completed building. ""A thousand foot dirigible... would add stress to the building's frame."" (¦ @NUM1) Not to mention that a large dirigible would also have placed stress on the building. Completing such a project would be extremely difficult because the building was not designed for docking dirigibles. This means the roof and the top floors would need to be converted to accommodate passengers and travel operations. Nature was also an obstacle that builders @CAPS1. High winds could cause the dirigible to violently sway. Weights used to tether the dirigibles could also be a safety hazard in a densley populated area such as @LOCATION1. Fire was another safety concern for the builders. The gases used to keep the dirigibles airborne were highly flammable and would again cause serious concern for safety in a city of millions. Ultimately all of these factors caused the creation of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building to fail."
