"The mood that the author created in the memoir is a warm, happy, pleasant feeling. When Narciso Rodriguez describes his home in Newark, @CAPS1, I get this really joyful feeling of his Cuban home. He states, ""my young parents created our traditional Cuban home... Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" From this statement, I can vividly see couples dancing to Cuban music and his parents making a meal. The positive warm mood that Rodriguez created was shown by diction, where he uses a specific word choice. When he uses the words like ""passionate"", or ""close-knit community."", I am able to get this warm feeling. Rodriguez also created the mood of happiness when he describes his Cuban feast with all his family and friend. He states, ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" (paragraph @NUM1) The mood of happiness and warmth is created by author throughout his vivid and descriptive details."
