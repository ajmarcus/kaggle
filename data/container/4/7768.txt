"The mood of this memoir is warm and friendly. This is easily recognizable because all of the poem was based on his family and his tightknit community. @PERSON1 five correct @PERSON2 explains everything about his home that made him who he is today. @PERSON2 also explains about his community and the diversity there. He talks about how his neighborhood is mostly made up of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. It @MONTH1 seem like this would be a tough neighborhood but he specifically says, ""... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. @PERSON1 also describes what life is like in his house he tells the reader that the ""heart"" of his house as the kitchen. His mother was always in there cooking a traditional Cuban meal. He also says that everyone (his landlord, his surrogate grandparents, his aunts, his cousins, and his extended family) would come to his house for dinner. Another thing is @PERSON1 would always praise his parents throughout the whole story. He would talk about how selfless and kind they were. He thanks them for his success in life. I believe that if it was very brave of @PERSON1's parents to move to the United States, but they did it for their children. @PERSON1 ends the article with a very inspirational quote. It is, ""I will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home."" That is the mood @PERSON1 sets for his memoir."
