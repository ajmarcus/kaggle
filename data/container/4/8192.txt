"In the @ORGANIZATION1 amemorie when in 1961 Narciso was born into a simple house. A cuban home filled with traditions, and the very heart of whitch was the kitchen. His parents who loved to cook is still with him today and for whitch I am eternally grateful. Passionate music witch he adores today. His neighborhood was madeup of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian imigrants like his family. His mother and father had come to this country with such courage without any knowledge or the culture. They came to selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it ment leaving behind their families, friends, and career in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh Northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. His mood shows lots of positive thing's about his family being proud what he is and what he stands for having the blood of being cuban. He seems very pleased on his familyes sucsess."
