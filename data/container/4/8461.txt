"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a very strong mood, and describes it very well. The mood of the story is happiness. One way the author describes this is with all the appretation in the memoir. The author really appretaties all the things his parents have done for him, that were really hard for them to do. ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" One more way the author reinforced the mood is with the carring in the story. Narciso cares so much for everything his parents did for him. Also, how his family would let other relatives stay with them and care for them. Lastly, all the culture helps the mood. The description of the cuban food and music and how they celebrate creates happy thoughts in the reader's mind. As you can see, the author was very good at creating a mood."
