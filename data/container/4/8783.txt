"In the nonfiction memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives the author created a warm, busy, and giving mood. The mood is warm because in the memoir it says ""the congregation of family and friends and endless celebration that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home"". This shows she were a lot of friends and family together in this home showing friends and family being together. Also the mood is busy because in the memoir it says ""countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporaily until they were able to get back on their feet"". This shows how people were always coming and going in this home. The mood was also giving. It was giving because in the memoir it says ""It was close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people, who while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need"". This shows how people were given when othrs needed help even if they were not the same kind. That is the mood the author gave in this memoir."
