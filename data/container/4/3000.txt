"There were many obstacles that the architects never realized while building the docking station for the dirigibles.  One of these obstacles they faced was height, and the lack of safety that arose from it.  In @DATE1, the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"", which use a highly flammable hydrogen, caught fire in New Jersey as described in paragraph thirteen.  Should this have happened to a dirigible docked high over New York City, the airship would plummet to to the ground where many New @CAPS1 would be going about about their day.  The largest obstacle they faced though was nature.  Air currents and storms would cause the dirigible, only teathered to the mooring mast by a rope, to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast... dangling high above pedestrians on the street.""  As pointed out in paragraph fourteen, this was neither practical, nor say if.  The third obstacle they faced with a pre-existing law against airships flying too low over urbanized areas.  Even as tall as the Empire State Building is, it was still impossible to legally dock at the new mooring mast.  Al Smith's idea finally had to be abandoned due to safety, nature, and state law."
