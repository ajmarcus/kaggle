"Narciso Rodriguez is thankful for what his parents gave him, thus that is the overlying mood in the memoir, being thankful. Rodriguez was thankful that his parents came over from Cuba to give him a better life. Even though he says that his parents had to leave behind ""family, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" Rodriguez is also thankful that his parents taught him selfless ness + generosity. For example, he says ""there was often someone staying with us temporarely until they were able to get ba- ck on their feet."" It is very genorous to help some body in that way. Over all Rodriguez is thankful for his Cuban culture. Cuban culture encompasses cooking & music, but most impo- rtant ly family, having nothing to do with being a blood relative, but the fact that you have respect + love for everyone. The mood of this memoir is being thankful and is presented in all these different ways."
