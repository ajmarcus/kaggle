"In the memoir Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives @PERSON1 he makes the mood seem the loving, cheerful, and grateful.The mood is grateful to Rodriguez's parents for making his house more of a home among other things. In paragraph @NUM1 he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 his parents did a ton for Rodriguez and he is constantly grateful. Their is also a lot of love in the mood of the book because there are lots of mentions of family. In paragraph @NUM2 it says ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family."" @CAPS2 arms opened and a big ""family"" are surely signs of lots of love. The mood of the excerpt is also cheerful because as Rodriguez says ""Passionate salsa music filled the air."" And ""a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air."" Music and feasting are two of the most cheerful things there are.By recalling experiences from his childhood @PERSON2 manages to make the mood of his memoir loving, grateful, and cheerful all at the same time."
