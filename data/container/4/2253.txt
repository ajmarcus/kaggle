"Constructing anything is always a difficult taksk, but trying to construct the worlds tallest building and have dirigibles being able to dock there is even harder. The workers who were modifing the Empire State Building had nemerous obstacles that stood in their way when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. The obstacle they could not controll was nature herself. The winds were said to be ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" according to the excerpt wich made it difficult for dirigibles to dock there, and dangerous. Also another factor that was an obsticle for the constructors was the building itself. The structure of the building would have to be modified because the dirigible ""would add stress to the building's frame,"" so constructors wolud have to make the building support this tremendous stress. Another obsticle was safty because some dirigibles were filled with hydrogen which was extremely flamable and dangerous for the massive population on the ground. These are a few of the many obstacles faced when modifing the Empire State Building."
