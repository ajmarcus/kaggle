"In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a very loving and carring mood.                                                         Throughout the memoir, Rodriguez can't stress enough how much love, greatfulness, and respect @CAPS1 has towards his parents. For example in paragraph @NUM1, Narciso Rodriguez says ""I will always be greatful for their love and sacrifice"", meaning the sacrifices parents made for their children. @CAPS1 also says ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseference... but, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for their spirit and generosity..."" @CAPS1 cares about the lessons his parents taught him so much, that @CAPS1 bases his life on them and will never forget them. But perhaps the most important thing Rodriguez says in this memoir is in paragraph @NUM2, when @CAPS1 says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This somes up everything his parents taught and sacrificed for him. giving this simple sentence a great meaning."
