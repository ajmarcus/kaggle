"In the story ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted, the builder's of the Empire State Building had many obstacles in the attempt of allowing dirigibles to dock. The huge balloon caused tension and stress due to its ginormous size. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of abuilding, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". The stress of the dirigible, can cause crucial damage on the buildings frame. Also, it was not only the size the contents of some of the planes caused a crisis aswell. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". The worrys of the balloon catching on fire was too much to risk. Along with all, is the power of nature itself. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The winds on top of the building were very violent compared to the ones in the ground causing a scare. It looked all good until everything was looked at carefully, obstacles came from all different ways."
