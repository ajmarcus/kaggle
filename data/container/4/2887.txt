"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION3 the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. One reason that it was difficult to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building was safety issues. According to Marcia Amidon LŸsted, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" With New York City and its dense population that is a risk that cannot be taken. Another obstacle faced by the architects of the Empire State Building was nature itself. The start of paragraph @NUM1 states, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" With high winds the dirigible, even tethered to the mast, would swivel around the mooring mast. Another difficulty in docking the dirigibles was according to the excerpt in paragraph @NUM2, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Due to this law it would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. A final obstacle the builders faced was the advancement with airplanes and that made it difficult for dirigibles to be the prime source of aeronautical transportation. Even though the builders spent a lot of time and effort in making the Empire State Building a national @CAPS1, which it is, they neglected many potential problems with the mooring mast which led to it never accomplish its full potential."
