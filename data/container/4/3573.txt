"The architects had to go through many obstacles such as having to rebuild the whole frame of the Empire State building. In paragraph nine it says ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof."" @CAPS1 they had to modify and strengthened the whole thing to accommodate the new situation. Another obstacle they had to face, was that hydrogen was highly flammable. When a German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that an accident like that could be worse in the crowded streets of New York. Another obstacle was nature itself. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The back of the ship would swivel around, but could be held down with lead weights, but like paragraph @NUM1 says ""using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling, is neither practical nor safe."" / Time"
