"The builders of the Empire state building encountered many obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking there. A main concern was safety, after Hindenburg, a German dirigible, was destroyed by fire over New Jersey. This prompted the realization that had such a disaster occurred over New York, a highly populated urban area, it could have been far worse. Another obstacle that was encountered was bad weather conditions. The winds on the top of the Empire State Building were consistently shifting, making it impossible for a dirigible to stay unmoving. If the dirigible was so unsteady, it would be very unsafe for it to be floating above millions of people. Lastly, it was illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the mast or even approach the area due to a law that prevented all airships from flying too low over urban areas. Due to all the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, it is apparent that dirigibles were simply not meant to dock there."
