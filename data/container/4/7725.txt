"The author, Narciso Rodriguez created a pleasant mood, with a family atmosphere in his memoir. First, he described his childhood home. With the great Cuban music and cuisine, his family, friends and the many celebrations, he painted a vivid image of fun and comfort. Next, he describes his neighborhood. With the many diverse cultures of all the immigrants, they work together, and kindness prevailed. The community would always extend their hands to one who was down on their luck. Third, he describes his friends and family who visited often. Their landlord and his daughter, Alegria; his surrogate grandparents Sergio and Edelmira; His aunts Bertha and Juanita; his cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary; the list goes on. His parents let all who needed a home to stay with them, because they knew that the others would help them if they needed shelter. Finally Narciso described the hardships and sacrifices his parents made for him, for which he is eternally grateful. His parents left behind friends, family, and their good jobs to start anew in @LOCATION3, also that he would live a better life than they. Because of this writing style; because of his vivid imagery; Narciso Rodriguez wrote an article that is not only pleasing to read, but that it also touches the heart."
