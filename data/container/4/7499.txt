"This is the mood that was conveyed by the author in the memoir. The mood is a very happy one. The author looks back on all the good times @CAPS1 had as a kid. @CAPS1 explains how Cuban culture was a big part of his life and how @CAPS1 still enjoys Cuban food and music. @CAPS1 also describes how his parents made their little apartment feel like a home.  In the last line @CAPS1 says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 also talks about how @CAPS1 lived in a neighborhood with all the other immigrants from all over the world. @CAPS1 describes how even though the familys from different places had almost nothing in common they'll all became very close. In the third paragraph it says, ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" That quote shows how close that neighborhood was even though they came from different places. Is happy in that memoir because @CAPS1 only revisits memories that @CAPS1 was fond of. That was the mood that was conveyed in the memoir."
