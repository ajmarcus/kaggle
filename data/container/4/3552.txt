"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State building face a good amount of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock upon it's mast.The wind proved to be a very big problem for the blimps. Not only would they swing about dangerously when tethered to the mast, that on the few occasions that a dirigible actually approached the Empire state building, they couldn't manuver close enough due to the wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Another thing that stood in the way of the Empire State Building's dock being used was the danger it presented to the buildings and people below. The gas, hydrogen, that dirigibles used to float is highly flammable. ""When the German dirigible was destroyed by fire,... the owners... realized how much worse the accident would have been... above a densely populated area."" The third and final obstacle they faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" With all that potential danger and to discouragement, it's no wonder the Empire State building was never used for docking dirigibles."
