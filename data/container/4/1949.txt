"In order for the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles (blimps), many obstacles had to be overcome by the architects. One of those obstacles was the Empire State Building's frame. If a thousand-foot dirigible was moored on top of the building with just a single cable tether, it would add tremendous stress to the foundation of the building due to the dirigibles load and wind pressure. Another obstacle that the architects faced was safety. Because dirigibles in the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium, there was a high risk of the dirigible exploding, and threatening the dense population of downtown New York City. Possibly the greatest obstacle that the architects had to face was high winds. On top of the Empire State Building, the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if lead weights could be used to weigh down and control the docked dirigible, they would still be unsafely dangling about the pedestrians of the streets below. Those are some obstacles that the architects of the Empire State Building faced in an attempt to dock dirigibles."
