"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Originally, the greatest problem builders faced was strengthening the building's foundational base in order to support the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure. To combat this, @MONEY1 of modifications had to made to the building's framework. Unfortunately, most of the complications of the mooring mast were not considered until after it was built. A most important one was safety, in that that many foreign dirigibles to use helium to float which is highly flammable. A disaster like the Hindenburg disaster over New York City is too dangerous to risk. Another preventer of the mast were the winds at the top of the building that were constantly changing due to the violent air currents. The swaying dirigible could not be secured with hanging weights due to the danger of dropping one over a very populated New York City. A huge complication of making the dream a reality was a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for a docking to ever take place. The many obstacles that face the builders of the Empire State building attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, eventually led to the dropping of the idea all together."
