"In the memoir written by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso shows a certain love and passion toward his family and culture. The mood of this memoir would be love and passion because of the words and emphisization his feelings. For instance, in paragraph three it states that family does not mean just blood relations. @CAPS1 talked about how all sorts of cultures came together as one and were always good friends along the way. Another way mood is expressed is through his foreshadowing, showing @CAPS1 kept the tradition going. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today"" and ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..."" @CAPS1 expresses his foreshadowing in two ways, by adding parentheses and just stating it. A third example of the mood in this memoir is the way @CAPS1 talked about the love for his family, and how important being thankful is. ""I have always told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" Narciso also states @CAPS1 can't thank his parents enough, and if they taught him none of that @CAPS1 would not be who @CAPS1 is as a person today. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Just adding the love and culture to one's house can turn it into a caring home!"
