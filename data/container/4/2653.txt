"While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building, the architects faced many obstacles. Usually, when given an obstacle, you either succeed it or fail it. In this case, these men didn't overcome the obstacle.In the reading, it mentioned that dirigibles from outside the U. S. contained hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and it could cause a lot of damage. Not only to the building itself, but the area of downtown New York as well. Winds at the top of the building were shifting due to air currents. This could cause the dirigibles to circle the mast when even tied down. The architects also had to think about the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The builders didn't realize how complicated the process of even tying down a dirigible would be because of the high winds. Even the process of dropping off newspapers was difficult, and took up too much time. Who would want in enormous steel framed balloons dangling over them anyways?"
