"There was many obstacles in the way of adding a mooring dock to the top of the Empire State Building. First was that new many modifications would have to be added to the frame of the building. This is because the previous frame could not hold the extra weight of a @NUM1 dirigible hanging from 1 cable. These additions would take ""1 over sixty thousand dollars"" plus extra time and effort,. Another huge problem was saftey. Winds around New York were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would lead to the blimb wraping around the tower and possibly break off or worse. Not to mention that all around was a densely populated city and any accident could cause much more destruction than normal. Forgein dirigibles also used mass amounts of hydrogen, which proven at Hindenburg, could explode into a massive flaming dunk of steel. This chance would be magnified with the weather and any accident would have high human and property costs. Finally, It was illegal for blimbs to fly low near a city, making the whole project illegal. As you can see there is many problems with having a blimb docking center on the Empire State Building."
