"Narciso Rodriguez @CAPS1 the following definition of family in this memoir. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity & friendship. My mother & father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find. I will always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrifice. They showed me with their own lives & these teachings have been the basis of my life. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent & music but life & love. It was here where i learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things i learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."
