"The mood that the author of this memoir is one of love and togetherness. The way that he describes his parents hard work and love is incredible. First, it says in @CAPS2 @NUM1 ""In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied chemical engineering. In the United States they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find."" This demonstrates love beond comperashin seening as they had to start over from scratch steping down far benith there potential to care for their children. They never gave up but instead kept going to try and give there children a better life than they would have had. Also this memoir expresses togetherness not only in the famley but in the community as a whole. As it says in @CAPS2 @NUM2 "" Our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and italian immigrants"" @CAPS1 even though they were of all kinds of races ""It was a close  knit community of honest hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who while not necessary their own kind, were clearly in need."" (@CAPS2 @NUM2) This was a community who cared for each other and helped out anybody in need of help despite raise. His parrents also kept their doors open and alowed people to just come in and stay until they were able to get back up onto their feet. Knowing that they would do the same for them. This takes a community that is very close to be able to do something like this. These are but a few of the different examples throghout this memoir that illistrate the mood that the author creates of love and togetherness."
