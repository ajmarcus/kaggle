"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" author Marcia Amidon Lsted speaks of the obsticles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, the frame of the Building had not been built to withstand a thousand foot long blimp docking to it. Therefore, changes would have to be made to make the building stronger. As the excerpt says, ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"". Also, having dirigibles dock to the building would be unsafe for many reasons. For example, dirigibles were often filled with hydrogen rather than helium, and as the excerpt points out ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" thus, the owners of the building realized that it could cause tragedy if a blimp were to crash while flying above New York's busy streets. Also, strong winds at the top of the building made it difficult and dangerous for blimps to dock at the mooring mast, because they would cause the back of the ship to constantly move. Finally, there were laws preventing aircrafts to fly so low over the city. There were many obsticles in allowing dirigibles to dock to the building."
