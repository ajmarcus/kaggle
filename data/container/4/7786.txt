"In the memoir, @PERSON1, from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author created a mood for @PERSON1. The mood the author created was something different, but it never seems to go down.As Narciso Rodriguez really gives you the definition of ""family"", in the memoir. One of the examples the author created for the mood is ""Growing up in this enviornment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relative."" In the paragraph before that they talked about moving into a new home, and to the heart was the kitchen, they cooked while listening to cubic music. Narciso said, ""she's internally grateful to know how to cook, and she still enjoys listening to cubic music."" Its a happy mood, showing memory. Another example is, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture."" Narciso's mood is suddenly more strict, but proud of her parents. The last example would be, in all of the last paragraph. ""It was at her home where she learned the real definition of 'family'."" ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Narciso's mood is so happy and pround to say that her home and family really meant a lot to her. The mood the author created for Narciso Rodriguez was always proud, happy, but never sad. She had a lot of memories from one home."
