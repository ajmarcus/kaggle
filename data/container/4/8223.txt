"The mood created by the author in the memoir is warm, grateful, and very palpable to the reader. One mood the author conveys very deeply is that of his love of his family. However, his ""family"" not only consisted of blood relatives, but also of the immigrants living in the neighborhood. He says, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" It is obvious that the author feels very strongly about the good relationships his family had with the other immigrants around them. His mood is warm and compassionate as he talks about how much each one of his community was important to him. The next mood conveyed by the author is gratitude and admiration for his parents. In paragraph @NUM1, he talks about how he will be forever grateful for his parents' sacrifices and their hardwork and the numerous times he has told them of his admiration for their strength and courage. However, he does not feel it is enough and says, ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The mood shown in this quote is that of thankfulness, and even a small bit of frustration that he cannot fully express his gratitude towards his parents."
