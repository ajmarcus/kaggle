"In this memoir from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, written by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso talks about how his family made his house a home. The mood he sets throughout the memoir is love, selflessness, and gratefullnes. This memoir shows love because of paragraph @NUM1, Rodriguez reminisces, ""countless extended family members came and went--and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This shows love because even if they weren't blood related, they still consider themselves family and cared for each other beyond belief. This memoir also has the mood of selflessness because Rodriguez says that they moved selflessly, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved and ended up facing many hardships to their new country. The last mood shown in this memoir is gratefullness. Narciso Rodriguez is grateful for his cooking abilities, his love for cuban music and for his parents love and sacrifice. Especially he is grateful for how his parents turned his simple house into a home."
