"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in the idea of docking a dirigible to a building of such height.      Dirigibles, mostly outside of the U.S., were made with hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is extremely flamable gas which was very dangerous above a highly populated are such as downtown @LOCATION2. Safety was a major concern an accident like Hindenburg was something they do not want to risk.      The ability of docking a lightweight flyer was also very difficut. With strong winds, after the tethor cable was attached, the back end of the air craft would be blown around making the aviator of the blimp hard to control.      Also, a law stating aircrafts may not fly too low to the buildings was stated especially after the incodent of hindenburg in New Jersey. A blimp could possibly hit a spire of another building     The reality of docking these lightweight aircrafts was a major saftey and difficult concern. These obstacles are what builders of the empire state building faced."
