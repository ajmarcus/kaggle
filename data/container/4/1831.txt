"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was modifying and strengthening the frame of the building. It says that ""over @NUM1 thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" in order to accommodate dirigibles. However, after the modifications were made, the builders had to face another set of obstacles, more serious than before. the first one was ""safety"": the destruction of the Hindenburg in @LOCATION3 raised fear for a densely populated area such as New York. Another obstacle was ""nature""; the strong winds and violent air currents on the top of the Empire State Building made dirigibles ""neither practical nor safe"". the third obstacle was ""an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas"". this law made it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" the Los Angeles and Columbia dirigibles attempted a few things, but unsuccessfully, and the idea of dirigibles disappeared by the late 1930's. these are the obstacles that the builders faced in attempting dirigibles to dock on the Empire state building."
