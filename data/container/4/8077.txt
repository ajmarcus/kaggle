"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the story has more of a  ""happy"" or ""joyful"" mood.  I chose those moods because one, it showed how peaceful and loving everyone was even if they weren't family, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Two, he said how happy he was for his unselfish parents, ""I was always greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was much more couragous thing than I could have ever done"". Finally, he explains how different everyone was, and yet can get along with each other so well, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" In conclusion, this is the mood I think the author created in the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez."
