"narciso Rodriguez is a clothing designer who wrote a memoir Home: The blueprints of our lives. The mood created in this memoir is a warm feeling that surrounds the meaning of family and home.narciso says in the memoir in @CAPS1 @NUM1 ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the Aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the back drop to lif in our warm home."" That proves that narcisos house was a warm family home, that was alway welcaming.narcisos comunity was also close like a family. In @CAPS1 @NUM2 it proves this when saying ""Close  knit community of hones, hard working imigrants who extent a hand to people who were clearly in need"". He also states that blood does'nt mean your family. Like his surrogate grandparents. In @CAPS1 @NUM3 he proves that his parents were alway welcoming  ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we concidered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."
