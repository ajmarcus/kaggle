"The builders of the Empire State Building had great plans to allow dirigibles, also known as blimps, to dock there. Although they kept their expectations high, they faced many obstacles while trying to make this happen. The first problem they ran into was the fact that the steel frame of the building would have to be strengthened due to the stress of the dirigible's load. So, the architects had to make changes to the building's skeleton. Safety was also an issue because hydrogen made the blimps flammable, which could cause a destruction by fire. There was also an existing law stating ""airships can't fly to low over urban areas."" @CAPS1, dirigibles wouldn't be allowed to tie up to the building, let alone even reach that area. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Due to heavy winds, the dirigibles would swivel around too much, and the area was not open enough to weigh down the back with lead weights. So, the architects of the Empire State Building faced too many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to successfully dock there."
