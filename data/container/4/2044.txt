"Based on the excerpt from the Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in building the mooring mast. For example, there was actually a law that prohibited exactly what the builders wanted. The law said that airships could not fly too low over city areas. The mooring mast on the Empire State Building would directly violate that law when the ships come in to dock. Another problem the builders faced was the danger surrounding the airships that would be docking there. The airships, called dirigibles, were like giant balloons and could pop if they touched something sharp enough. The Empire State Building was surrounded by other extremely tall buildings and most of them had long spires on top. Therefore, if the dirigible bumps one of these spires, it could pop and go plummeting to the ground. This presented another problem. Had an airship popped in New York City, it could've killed a large number of people not only in it, but on the ground. During the time of building, the Hindenburg crashed into fields, killing all of it's passengers. The builders thought what the consequences would be if that had happened in the city. This was the final straw for the builders as they abandoned their lofty goal, because of too many problems."
