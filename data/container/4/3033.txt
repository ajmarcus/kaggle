"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles such as the use of hydrogen, air currents, and existing laws, in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building. The first obstacle the builders had encountered was the use of hydrogen in most dirigibles outside the United States. Hydrogen is considered highly flammable, a big safety issue. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as down town New York."" (@NUM1) If this had occurred in New York the damage could of been a lot worse.Another obstacle the builders faced was the violent air currents. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (@NUM1) this is very dangerous because of pedestrians on the street.The final obstacle was an already existing law that prohibits airships flying low over urban areas. ""The law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building."" (@NUM3) this law would not allow dirigible to approach New York.
