"There were obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the many obstacles the dirigibles had to face was the lack of a suitable landing area, which I found on paragraph six. Another obstacle would be on paragraph @NUM1 where it says ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Nature itself would be another obstacle for the dirigibles, because ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" @CAPS1 but not least, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Which means it is illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even go near the area. In conclusion these were some out of the many obstacles a dirigible had to face."
