"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. These obstacles included having to redesign and modify the building structure, the dangers of a dirigible catching fire, the swirling winds, and state law. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (@NUM1) This was because the building was not originally built to have that capability. This meant, in order to do this meant over sixty thousand dollars in modification had to be spent. Another obstacle faced was the natural dangers of a dirigible. Dirigibles have a likely chance of catching fire, as displayed by the Hindenburg. If that same accident were to happen over the densely populated area of New @CAPS1 it would be a catastrophe. Another obstacle was that the winds up above the building are always swirling rapidly. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back the ship would swiveled around, and around the mooring mast"" (@NUM2) This would just be dangerous to have something that large spinning round and round. The last obstacle faced by builders was that state law @CAPS2 aircraft flying as low as the mooring mast. This would make it illegal for the mooring mast to be used. This probably should have been considered. Overall poor planning created very many obstacles for builders in letting dirigibles dock there."
