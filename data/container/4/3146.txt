"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the challenges of creating a Mooring mast on top of a 1,250 foot tall building are discusted. In the @DATE1's Al Smith, the govener at the time had the idea of makeng the empire state building equipted with its own landing dock for Dirigibles. Throughout the process the builders were faced with many obstacles in there attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building. The first obstacle was getting the mast on top of the building. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). If the builders did do that it would cause too much stress to the building. The problem was solved after spending over @MONEY1 on a steal frame to support the mast.However, most of the builders problems were not able to be solved. Safety was a major issue, most dirigibles were built with hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamible. It would be a huge problem if a fire occured over a densely populated area. Also the dirigibles would be too high up to be tied down. Also if the dirigibles did land there it would in violation of an existing law. Therefore the builders were faced with so many obsticles they were unable to build the mast."
