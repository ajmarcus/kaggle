"The empire state builders faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable. when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been above a densely populated area such as down town newyork. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Another obstical the builders faced was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building, or even approach the area, although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped."
