"The over all mood created by the author in the memoir is gratitude. A quote from paragraph @NUM1 is, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that expressed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote shows that Narciso grew up in a very warm and happy home and he is very happy and grateful for that.  Another quote is, ""I've often told them that what they did was much more courageous than I could have ever done."" paragraph @NUM2 This shows that his parents must have done something very hard and gave up a lot to give him to have a good life. A quote from paragraph @NUM3 is, ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood for the many things I learned there about love."" This shows that he is so grateful to his parents for teaching him so much about life, love, and family that he would have never known if it weren't for them."
