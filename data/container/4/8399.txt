"The mood created by the author in the memoir is greatful. @PERSON1 is greatul for many reasons. Some things he is greatful for is his parents his home his culture and his family. I say this because he mentioned these topics alot in the memoir. One reason he is greatful is for his parents culinary skills, As said in the memoir ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still in me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)"".  Another reason @ORGANIZATION1 is greatful is for the love his parents give him because without his parents love and sacrifice he wouldn't have the courage he has. I know this because in the memoir @PERSON1 said ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done"". The next reason @PERSON1 is greatful for his family because they are always there for him that is the reason his parents always keeps the door open to family. @PERSON1 is greatful for life and love. It was there when he learned the real definition of family, and this is why he would never forget the place he called home."
