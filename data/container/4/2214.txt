"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock their. First, the expectations of the project were unrealistic because there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS1 even if they found a safe way to land dirigibles they would be breaking the law. Second, there were ""violent air currents."" When they tried to dock the dirigible on the building, it could not get close enough to it to land because of the wind. Lastly, it was a huge safety hazard. Most dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium,"" and hydrogen is very Flammable. In a densely populated area. ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how [bad an] accident could have been. As a result, dirigibles never fulfilled the expectations of the transportation of the future and they did not dock on the Empire State Building."
