"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted, builders of the Empire State Building were faced with obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The author writes, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mas was nature itself."" (Lsted, paragraph @NUM1) It was reported that the winds on top of the building were constantly changing because of violent air currents. A dirigible on the building would not be able to land properly or be weighted down with lead weights like those in open landing fields. It would not be practical to dangle weight over the heads of hundreds of people walking in the streets below. In addition to nature itself, safety was another great obstacle that the builders were faced with. It is written that, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (Lsted, paragraph @NUM2). Since hydrogen is highly flammable, an accident could be extreme in a densely populated area like downtown New York where the Empire State Building was located. An accident had already occurred with a German dirigible by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. When all is said and done, nature and safety were two obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
