"Narciso Rodriguez expresses many moods of happiness in the memoir. @CAPS1 is thankful, ""But, in reallty, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" That statement shows how thankful Narciso is to have such a wonderful life full of great friends and families. The mood of the memoir is very up-beat because Narciso is talking about how great his life has been since @CAPS1 was born. ""I've often told them of my admiration for there strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" That quote shows how proud @CAPS1 is of his parents because they gave up their families, friends, and careers so that @CAPS1 could have a better life in @LOCATION1. Narciso says, ""my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" @CAPS1's saying that @CAPS1's very happy that his parents did that for him. Many quotes from the memoir support and set the mood to describe Narciso's life."
