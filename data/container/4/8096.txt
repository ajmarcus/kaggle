"In the memoir, by Narciso Rodriguez, a distinct mood of family and caring is set. The first way this mood is set is by the the passionate Cuban music and the home cooked meals. Rodriguez writes, ""passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" (p. @NUM1). This quote exentuates the mood of family because the music and food of thier nationality gives a feeling of comfort. The comfort with you family and to the mood of family. Another way the mood of family is portrayed is the size of the house. Rodriguez writes,""... I was born in this simple house situated in a two family, blonde-brick building..."" (p. @NUM2). This adds to the mood of family because living in a small house means that a lot of the time will be spent with family. This also adds a cozy feel to the environment. Finaly, the mood of family is contributed to by how close their family lives. Rodriguez writes, ""My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria and Rosemary also live nearby"" (p. @NUM2). Family living nearby contributes to the mood of family because it exentuntes the number of family members which exentuates the mood of family. Based on the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, a strong mood of family is expressed."
