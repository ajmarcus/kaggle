"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by @ORGANIZATION2, certain obstacles such as foundation support, nature, and safety challenged the building of the docking station for dirigibles. The first problem the architects faced was the docked dirigibles placing too much stress on the building. To combat this problem, drastic changes to the building would have to be made. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1, @CAPS2 @NUM2) This change was stated to cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle the builders faced upon constructing the mooring mast, was nature. At this height, the wind currents are violent and unpredictable. Despite being tethered to the building, the dirigibles would spin and twist around the mass, an unsecure and dangerous aspect. Lastly, as the except claims the greatest reason for not being successful, the safety violations of the mast were too great. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen... and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident would have been...above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (@CAPS1 @NUM3, @CAPS2 @NUM4) The moor provided severe risk to the safety of the people of New York. This problem served as a serious problem, thus serving as an obstacle for the builders of the mooring mass. The building's foundations, nature, and safety violations all served as problems for the builders creating the mooring mass."
