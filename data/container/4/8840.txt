"In the story, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" the narrator had shown happiness throughout the memoir.One example of when the author showed happiness was when they were thinking about cooking. They admired when their parents helped and teached them how to cook. They would hear the music in the back that they adored as their heritage or backround. In the story it says, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking.""When the authors still live with their parents their relatives would come over to eat and have fun. To reflect back on those memories made the author happy. In the story it says, ""Countless extended family members came and went-- and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back upon their feet.""@CAPS1 example is when the author thought of the time when their parents moved to @LOCATION1. They thought of how lucky their parents were to come to such a nice place. In the story it says, ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."
