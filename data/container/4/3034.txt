"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigables to dock there was that the stress of the dirigables load and wind pressure could have caused problems to the buildings foundation. A thousand-foot dirigble, held by a single cable tether. would add stress to the buildings frame.Safety was another issue, most dirigbles outside the United States used hydrogen, instead of helium. This is a problem because hydro gen is highly flammable. On May 6, 1937, the German dirigble Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in New Jersey. the accident would have been more dangerous in New York because the city is densely populated.Another reason why they faced problems to allow dirigables to dock is because there was an existing law against airships flying too close over urban areas. In December 1930, the @ORGANIZATION2 dirigble did attempt to reach the mooring mast but could not reach because of the winds, fearing that it may blow the dirigble onto sharp spires of other buildings. This would puncture the dirigbles shell."
