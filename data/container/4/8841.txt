"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very thankful. Again and again @CAPS1 thanks his parents for several of the things that they gave to him that @CAPS1 still values. First, @CAPS1 thanks them for passing on their love of cooking and music which @CAPS1 says @CAPS1 is ""externally greatful"" for and which @CAPS1, ""adores to this day."" @CAPS1 is thankful for how they brought him up, showing this by writing how much @CAPS1 still enjoys these things today. Next, Narciso Rodriguez says how @CAPS1, ""will always be gratful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 describes how they did so much to give their child a better life. They sacrificed their laboratory and chemical engineering jobs to work their way up from the very bottom in @LOCATION1 to give their children more opportunity. His parents left behind, ""their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" @CAPS3, they did all of this with, ""The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."" The parents sacrificed so much because they wanted so badly for their children to have a good life and for this Narciso Rodriguez is extremely greatful."
