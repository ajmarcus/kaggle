"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were numerous, but the main obstacles consisted of the danger that dirigibles posed, nature, and an existing law against letting airships fly too low over the suburban areas. According to the reading, the danger that dirigibles posed was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is considered highly flammable"". This danger was emphasized by the German dirigible Hindenburg when it was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Nature was also a great obstacle because of the ""winds on top of the building"" that ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Because of these winds, it was almost impossible to dock a dirigible on the mooring mast without it moving around crazily. The last obstacle, the law, ""would make it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Unless the law was revoked, the mooring mast would never be able to work. However, the obstacle that the builders faced when designing the actual mast itself were that ""the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened"" because ""the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to building's foundation"" which turned out to be ""over sixty thousand dollars worth modifications."""
