"The Empire State Building is known for its great size & distinctive shape in New York City's @CAPS1, but what most people probably do not know is that the tower on top is actually a mooring mast for dirigibles. This is probably a little known fact because it could never actually be used to dock blimps for numerous reasons: safety, nature, & the law.The mast would have revolutionized travel in New York if international dirigibles could stop there after long Transatlantic flights, however, because of the gas used by foreign blimps, safety would have been a huge issue. In paragraph @NUM1, the author states, ""most dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, & hydrogen is highly flammable."" There was even an accident with the German Hindenburg, & if a blimp caught fire over densely populated @CAPS2 this would be an even greater problem of safety. Nature was also a matter of safety that needed to be considered. At such a great height there are strong, unpredictable winds, & ""even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around & around the mooring mast"" (paragraph @NUM2). There were no means of anchoring the back of the blimp because heavy weights such as those which would be used in open field landings would pose a serious threat hanging off the back of a blimp from over @NUM3 feet with pedestrians below There was simply no practical way to combat the nature that prevented the possibility of blimp stocking.Finally, it would have been illegal for a dirigible to dock at the mooring mass on the Empire State building. It was against the law for ""airships flying too low over urban areas"" ( @NUM4). The law ended up being the final obstacle that could not be overcome, so the Empire State Building never became a docking post for blimps, but it is still an incredible architectural feat."
