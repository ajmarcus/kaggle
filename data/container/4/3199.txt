"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem the builders faced was that a dirigible being moored to the top of the building would add stress to its frame. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly @NUM2 feet below."" The builders had to make sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to strengthen the frame of the building. Another major problem they faced was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium."" Hydrogen is extremely flammable and after an incident with a German dirigible being destroyed, they realized how dangerous it would be over a densely populated area. Another reason was nature. In paragraph @NUM3 it says ""The winds on top of the building were constantly moving."" This made it hard to tie up and keep the aircraft steady for passengers to get off safely. Even a navy pilot ""could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" There was even a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The mooring on top of the Empire State building was destined to fail because of all the obstacles that the builders faced."
