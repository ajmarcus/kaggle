"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author depicts a mood with distinct traits. One trait of the mood is selflessnes and courage. It is shown in paragraph @NUM1 when the author says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it ment leaving behind their families, freinds, and careers in the country they love."" Would you be able to throw away your life, into an alien world, just so that your children would have a better future? Doing this would take lots of selflessnes and courage. Also, the mood has gratefulness. The author shows this in paragraph @NUM2 when he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows the author's gratefulness towards his parents for their selflessness and courage for coming over to @LOCATION2 to give him a better future. Finally, unity is found in the mood. It is found in paragraph @NUM3 when it says, ""in our neighborhood, despite customs else where, all of these cultures come together in great solidarity and freindship. It was a close- knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This shows great unity in their neighborhood because in other parts of the United States, these three races didn't get alond, but in this neighborhood they were unified. In conclusion, the author depicts a mood with distinct traits."
