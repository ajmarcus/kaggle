"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many natural oposition in attempting to allow derigibles to dock in the building. Nature forces were a total threat to the idea of the dirigibles landing on the Empire State building: ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" which wouldn't be safe for the people getting in and off the dirigible because the ship would swivel around and around the morning mast. Other oposition to the idea was that most dirigibles that came from outside the U.S didn't use helium, but hydrogen which is highly flamable and risked the life of the people who lived around the Empire State building. Also the law was against this idea. There was a law that prohibet airships to fly too low over the urban areas. This law made the docking of the ships in the Empire State building illegal. The builders of the Empire State building confronted both natural and social oposition to the landing of the ships in the Empire State building."
