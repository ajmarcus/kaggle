"In this memoir written by Narciso Rodriguez, he portrayed a very specific mood. This mood made me feel that I was there, or part of the story that he was telling. I felt this way because by familiarizing your readers with your characters, that makes writing the rest of the story a lot easier. For example, in paragraph two, I was able to get a sense of what his home and family life was like-especially with this line, ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" @CAPS1 line that I felt was special to the story was, ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who... were clearly in need"" I liked this statement especially because it showed me, as the reader, how caring those people were. It also brightened the mood of the whole story. The overall mood of this memoir, I feel, was clearly depicted."
