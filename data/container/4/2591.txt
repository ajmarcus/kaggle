"The builders of the Empire State Building faced more problems than expected to. One of the first problems they faced was the building's frame could not support an enormous dirigible. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation... over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework"" (@NUM1). The builders were forced to modify the framework which cost a large amount of money, and proved to be a primary obstacle. Another obstacle the builders faced was the wind caused by nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@NUM1). These winds could potentially make the back of the blimps swivel around the mooring mast, making it incredibly difficult or dangerous to get on or off of the dirigibles. Finally, the builders faced the problem of laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (@NUM3). If ships could not even legally approach the building, the builders realized, the obstacles were too great for the mooring mast to work. After realizing all the problems and dangers associated with this idea, they decided the mooring mast would never be successful."
