"The author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates a very happy mood in his memoir. One reason the mood is happy is because of the setting. Narciso describes his house and says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the back-drop to life in our warm home."" The author describes a home filled with many good friends and good memories. Anothe reason is how grateful the author sounds. It says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" While they had to leave everything behind they did it for their kids and for a new life. The author is happy that they did. Also, the author credits the house with giving him a family. @CAPS1 says, ""It was here that I learned the real definition of the word 'family.' And for this, I will be forever grateful."" @CAPS1 learned a lot in this house and is very happy for that. In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir @CAPS1 creates a very happy mood."
