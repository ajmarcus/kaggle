"The mood created by the author in the memoir was being gratefull. The author takes paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2 to fully explain his gratitude to his parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). These are the @NUM5 main points from paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2. The author is thanking his parents for the numerous amount of things they have done for him, he is grateful. The author shows his gratitude throughout the excerpt, this common mood always remains.For instance, in @CAPS1 @NUM8 the author reminds the reader that ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Or in @CAPS1 @NUM9 when he writes ""my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or courage."" As you can see, the author constantly reminds the reader of how thankful/grateful he is to his parents. This sets the mood of being grateful throughout the story!"
