"The mood created in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is grateful and happy. First, @CAPS1 is very grateful because @CAPS1 says ""...To give their children a better life"" His parents gave up what they were doing in their homeland Cuba to come live in @LOCATION1 to make a better life for their child to start off and live in. @CAPS1 recognizes this but, @CAPS1 also knows @CAPS1 can never do enough to thank them. Next, it says ""family has nothing to do with love relatives."" @CAPS1 is very grateful and thankful that @CAPS1 grew up in the neighborhood @CAPS1 did where everyone was treated like brothers and sisters and they all felt saf in their community that they created. Also the story says ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done."" @CAPS1 knows that it took a lot of heart to do that much for someone else when all it did for his parents was make their lif tougher. They had to start over and that is what made him most grateful for his parents. That is what I truly think the mood of the story is."
