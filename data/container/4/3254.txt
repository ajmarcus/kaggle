"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem, according to the excerpt, is that ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the frame."" They would need to spend over @MONEY1 in order to modify the building's framework. Another issue, ofcourse, was the safety of the mast. Most of the zeppelins from places besides the U.S., did not use helium. Instead, those limbs used hydrogen which is highly flamable and would have caused disaster if ignited above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. The excerpt also states that, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" @CAPS1, there was already a law in place preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas, There fore, it would be illegal for a blimp to attach to or even go near the Empire State Building. For the reasons stated, builders were not able to build a mooring mast a top the Empire State Building."
