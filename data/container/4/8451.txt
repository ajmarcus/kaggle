"The author in the memoir created many different moods. One of the moods the author set was sympathetic or a sense of sympathy for the parents and how they only could live in a one-room furnished apartment. Another mood that was created was the mood of being proud. The author set this when they were talking about how he was born into a simple house and now he adored the music, culture, cooking and family. The author set a mood of sadness when he stated that it was a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. This creates a sad mood because of racism is a bad concept and also because the family is Cuban. Other moods that the author set were moods of gratetfulness and happiness. The author set a mood of gratefulness towards the end of the excerpt when he started saying how he is so thankful for having selfless parents and caring parents. Also when he said he had a humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just a scent and music but life and love. Happiness was the mood of the author because he lived in a good home, had a family full of love and care, and when he said I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."
