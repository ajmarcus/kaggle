"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles was that they would have to modify the entire building's steel frame so that it could withstand the extra stress and pressure of having a dirigible moored to its top. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to made to the building's framework."" Another obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced was that dirigibles were highly flammable because they were filled with hydrogen. The owners realized it may be a bad idea when the Hindenburg burst into flames. If that had happened at the Empire State Building it would have had extremely drastic results. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire... The owners of the Empire State The building realized how much worse that accident could of been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The biggest obstacle though was nature itself; ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... The back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" @CAPS1 were just three of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there."
