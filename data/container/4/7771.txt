"This memoir by Narciso Rodriguez has a grateful mood. @CAPS1 is thanking his nieghbors for the unity that @CAPS1 had in his community and explaining how @CAPS1 learned about family from them. @CAPS1 is also thanking his parents for giving up everything they had in Cuba to give him a good home. For example, @CAPS1 explains that @CAPS1 had a ""close-knit community of honest, hardworking,"" ""Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrants at a time when Overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed."" @CAPS1 says his neighbors helped people who were, ""not necessarily their own kind, (but) were clearly in need."" In paragraph @NUM1, @CAPS1 describes the things @CAPS1 loved about his ""traditional Cuban home"". In paragraph @NUM2, @CAPS1 says, ""My Mother and father came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly... to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love. @CAPS1 describes his parents hardships and says @CAPS1 will, ""always be grateful... for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 makes it clear that the passage is written with gratitude."
