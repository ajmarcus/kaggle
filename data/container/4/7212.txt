"The mood created by the author, Narciso Rodriguez, is clear in the memoir. You can sense throughout the whole story that he is completely grateful to his parents for the love they gave him, and their home life.                 In paragraph @NUM1, it says ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen"". Rodriguez is ""eternally grateful"" for his parents who ""unwittingly passed on to meet their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today"". They always had Passionate Cuban music that filled the air ""Mixing with kitchen aromas."" At the end of paragraph @NUM1, he says ""Here, the innocence of childhood, congregation of family + friends, and endless celebrations form the backdrop to life in our warm home. I will never forget how my parents turned this house into a home."""
