"The mood created by the author in the memoir is love, caring, and thankfulness. I say this because she really appriciates what her parents have done for her. In @CAPS1 @NUM1, she says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice, my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" Also, ""it was a close knit community of honest, hard-working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were really in need.""; @CAPS1 @NUM2. This shows that Narciso and her family can trust the people in their community which is a thankful mood. Because they know that they would never do anything to hurt them. In the last @CAPS1, it says ""it was here where I learned the real definition of family and I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows how thankful, loving, and caring he is to his parents. Narciso is proud of his parents because they let people stay with them, when they need to.. This is the moods created by the author in the memoir."
