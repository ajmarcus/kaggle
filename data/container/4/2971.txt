"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their. One obstacle was that a dirigible moored at the top of the building held by single cable, would add stress to the buildings frame. The still frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened to withstand the stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, causing the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast. Another major obstacle was that there was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for the ships to ever tie up or even approached the building. The last obstacles the builders had to get around was the issue with safety. Most dirigibles used either helium or hydrogen, both highly flammable gases. When the Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, the builders realized how dangers that could be over a populated area. These are just some of the many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to take into consideration when attempting to allow dirigible to dock their."
