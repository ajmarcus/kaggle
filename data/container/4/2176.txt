"Builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles when trying to dock dirigibles. One obstacle in docking dirigibles was the framework of the building. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" This shows the amount of work that needed to be done just on the structure of the building. Another hardship was that most dirigibles outside of the United States were filled with highly flamable hydrogen rather than helium. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst on May 6, 1937, the owners of the empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area."" @CAPS1 how dangerous the hydrogen could be. Lastly, dirigibles could be weighed down by led weights. ""using these at the Empire State Building, would be dangling over pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" @CAPS2 if the lead weights dropped they could kill someone. Many hardships were brought about trying to dock dirigibles at the empire state building"
