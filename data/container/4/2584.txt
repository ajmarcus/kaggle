"When attempting to allow dirigibles to dock attop the Empire state building, the builders were faced with obsticles. One obsticle they faced was the strong wind current. As said in paragraph @NUM1, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mast. Another obsticle was the added stress that would be put on the foundation of the building. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate..."" as stated in paragraph @NUM2. A third obsticle the builders faced in this matter was the dangers of fire, as well as the chances of endangering those down below, which is discussed in paragraph @NUM3. One last obsticle faced by the builders was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM4). Those are just some of the many major obsticles faced by builders, attempting to dock dirigibles on the top of the then tallest building in the world."
