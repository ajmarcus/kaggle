"In the excerpt Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, the mood created is togetherness, love, and friendship. This story talks about coming to @LOCATION1 and being welcomed in by an aray of people whom you don't know, but are treated like family. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (¦.@NUM1) No matter if you were Spanish, Italian, Cuban, or whatever else, you were treated with love and respect. This portrays the mood of friendship and caring because although they are not ""blood"" family. they take care of eachother as a family member would. Narciso's parents are a large inspiration in his life. ""It was where I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" (@NUM2). This excerpt shows that by just being there and looking out for eachother brings you closer to one another. "
