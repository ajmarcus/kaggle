"The mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful, joyful, and loving. The mood is grateful because the author's parents were such wonderful people, that made the author look up to them. The author even says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. The mood is also joyful because, although the author lived in just a simple house, inside, there was always music and he was influenced by his culture. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" After all a house is only a ""home"" if you feel welcome and love, and that is exactly how the author felt. Lastly, the mood is loving because in his home, his parents welcomed anyone who needed help. Example from the memoir is, ""My parents kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Over all, the author kept the mood lively and definitely happy, although the happiness went on through difficult times like segregation."
