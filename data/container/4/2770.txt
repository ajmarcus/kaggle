"One of the big problems facing docking dirigibles is the government and the law. It is illegal to have such a low-flying aircraft. It says, ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). Another obstacle would be safety. Dirigibles are FLAMMABLE and could easily injure and kill people if an accident happened. Is to dangerous, ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen... hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS2. @NUM2) Another problem is nature and weather. The winds up there are extremely high and powerful. A big danger to dirigibles, ""... violent air currents... back of the ship would swivel around... high above pedestrians,"" (@CAPS2. @NUM3)."
