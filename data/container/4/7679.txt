Rodriguez writes, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me there rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (And) for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixed with the aromas of the kitchen."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This shows him grateful to his parents for passing on their culture to him. Next he writes about how they regularly had large dinners where they invited neighbors. Rodriguez writes, ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family knowing that they would do the same for us."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2).
