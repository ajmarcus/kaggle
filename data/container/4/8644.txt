"The mood of this memoir is the importance of family. @ORGANIZATION1 says in the beginning how much he loves his cuban culture and heritage. For example, ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me there rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" Narciso Rodriguez enjoyed his ethnicity very much. Him and his family were always very open and welcoming to other people. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, Knowing that they would do the same for us.""  Narciso also became close to other immigrants that were not blood-related to him. ""Growing up in this envirement instilled me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighberhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants."" Narciso was close to many people who he considered family."
