"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was trying to moor a dirigible at the top without stressing the building too much. It says, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation."" This means they planned to deal with this problem by spreading this stress all the way to the foundation of the building. Another obstacle that was faced was trying to keep the dirigibles from moving and swaying too much, once they were moored. It says, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" It was impossible to keep the dirigibles from moving because the wind was so violent. The last problem was that even if they could get a dirigible to moor to the building, it was illegal to fly the airships that low in an urban area. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" In conclusion, all of these obstacles that the builders faced led to the final result of being unsuccessful."
