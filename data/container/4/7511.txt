"The mood created in the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"", from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"", is a mixture of happiness, relaxation, and gratefulness, even thought the memoir sometimes states how @PERSON1' parents had to give up their jobs in Cuba, and how overt racism was normal and segregation prevailed in the United States at the time, giving the mood as sadness, the article mainly consists Of happy memories. An example of this can be found throughout the story, especially in the ending paragraph when Narciso Rodriguez sums up the memoir and expresses how grateful he was toward his parents and the childhood he had. Also in the third and fourth paragraphs when he talks about his neighbors and how everybody got along with eachother, and how they frequently had meals together, I find the mood to be relaxing in paragraph three and four also, but mainly in paragraph @NUM1 when he talks about his kitchen and the smells, aromas, and music that used to dance through the air. The over all mood of the memoir could be considered gratefullness. I could be considered gratefulness because Narciso Rodriguez always states how grateful he is for his parents and child hood."
