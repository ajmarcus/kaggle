"The mood set in this memoir by the author, was greatfullness, and it seemed to be thanking his Family for such a loving childhood. It also seems @CAPS1 misses it. ""I was born into this simple house"" @CAPS1 says ""within it's walls, my young parents created our traditional cuban home."" @CAPS1 was very comfortable in his home and @CAPS1 loved it. It seems as thogh the excerpt was made to thank those who @CAPS1 lived with. As it says in paragraph @NUM1 ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS2 the excerpt @CAPS1 explains how caring, and generous his family and neighbors were."" My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" The author tells about his neighbor making delicious meals all the time, and their dinner table consisted of many neighbors, and blood relatives. The author had a very close relationship with his neighbors."
