"In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author creates a mood in the story, the author does this by writing in a certain way. One way the author does this is by writing very empathetacly. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (paragraph @NUM1). A second way the author sets the mood is by sneaking in deeper thoughts within the paragraphs and parentheses. For example in paragraph @NUM2. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.)"" A third way the author sets the mood is by speaking so fondly of their parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done"". (paragraph @NUM3). The overall mood that the author sets for this memoir is a kind, sweet and thankful mood, Narciso Rodriguez, is thankful for many thing; family, culture and living in america."
