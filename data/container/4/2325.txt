"One obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was how to do it safetly. According to the reading, it says that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Another obstacle was nature itself. This sentence, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" located at the beginning of paragraph @NUM1, proves that docking dirigibles at the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was unsafe.       Last but not @CAPS1, another reason why dirigibles could not dock was because it was illegal. There was ""an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas."" Because of that law, it would make it illegal for dirigibles to even approach the area. Therefor it would be impossible for a ship to land there."
