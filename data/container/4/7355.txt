"In 1956 Narciso Rodriguez's parents arrived in the united states and bought a @NUM1 room apartment. In 1961 Narciso was born and @CAPS1 began his life. In this story Narciso describes his childhood. The home was very likely, it was a traditional cuban home that consisted of a kitchen that was the heart of the home. Both of his parents loved to cook and listened to cuban music. Narciso says ""The passionate cuban music filled the air, mixing with The aromas of the kitchen."" @CAPS1 also got a good sense of family. and it was not just those who were related to you but also those who cared for you. Although people were different (customs or culture's) they still all came together. People often came to Narciso's home and let them stay while getting back to life because they believed in doing so for one another. Narciso was extremely grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. They taught narciso about the true meaning of love and family they also created a home with memories @CAPS1 will never forget."
