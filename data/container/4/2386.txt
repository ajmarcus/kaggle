"The empire state building's construction workers attempted to build a dirigible dock on top of the world's tallest building but many problems occured during the process. In order to have a dirigible dock on the top of the building the building would have to withstand its weight. ""The steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this situation. over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework."" (@CAPS2 @NUM1)"" The 102 story floor building was predicted to be a success and predicted to become the new age of aviation travel. Another obsitcle that the workers faced was realizing that dirigibles outside the @CAPS1 were highly flammable because they contain hydrogen. It would be disastrous if one caught on fire on the top of the building in New York City. ""The greatest obsticale to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature its self."" (@CAPS2 @NUM2)."" There are very strong and violent winds at the top of the building, the blimp could become a hazard if it was blown out of control A blimp hovering over hundreds of pedestrians in the city of New York is a definite hazard. There is also a law forbidding aircraft flying to low over populated areas. Having a mooring dock was a good idea but it was never really practicol or safe, many bad things could of happened if it was actually working."
