"Back in the roaring @NUM1's and @NUM2's, New York City was a popular place which needed to adapt to the ways of modernizing travel. A new and fashionable form of travel was the blimp, or the dirigible. These @ORGANIZATION2 balloons had nowhere to dock in the @ORGANIZATION2, and solving that solution was harder than expected.Al Smith, architect of the Empire State Building decided that he could use the top of the tower as a mooring mast for these dirigibles. After adapting the entire building for the change, Smith ran into a few problems.The first @ORGANIZATION2 issue surfaced when a German dirigible exploded in New Jersey. This let Smith know that it would be a bad idea to allow any @CAPS1 blimps near as most non-American crafts were filled with ""hydrogen [which] is highly flammable,"" leaving possibility for catastrophe. Another snag was the ""winds on top of the building... shifting due to... air currents"" which would cause the dirigibles to freely and dangerously sway in the wind. With the wind, they could crash into towers and ""would be dangling above pedestrians."" @CAPS2 valves also came into play as there was a preexisting law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" which would make any dirigible activity with the Empire State Building downright illegal."
