"I think that the main mood created by the author in the memoir was love. But love branched out into gratitude and hospitality. Love is shown a lot through family in this memoir. The love of the authors parents is shown in paragraph @NUM1, when it says ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life..."" Love from the author's parents is shown again in paragraph @NUM1 when it says ""The faith that this struggle would leave them and their children to better living drove them to endure these hard times."" These two quotes show the love that the author's parents showed towards their children. A mood of hospitality was also shown in this memoir a lot. In paragraph @NUM3, it shows hospitality by saying ""it was a close-knit community of... immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This shows the hospitality of the neighborhood and how caring it was. The other mood that the author created in the memoir was gratitude in paragraph @NUM4, this is shown. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told him that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" This quote shows how massively grateful the author is toward her parents. These are the ways that the author shows the mood in the memoir. "
