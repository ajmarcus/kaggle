" There were many obstacles faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building.One of these obstacles was the wind currents atop the building. They were uncontrolable, forceful and unexpected. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 it explains how a U.S. Navy dirigible attempted to dock but could not due to the winds, ""U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds"" (LŸsted) @CAPS2 the winds were an issue. Another problem was a law against airships that flew to low to the ground in urban areas. Not only was the idea dangerous, but it was also illegal. On May 6, 1937, a German dirigible called Hindenburg exploded in Lakehurst, New Jersey. This was due to the flammable hydrogen that was used to lift the dirigible. Since all dirigibles at this time obtained hydrogen another threat was introduced. This was the chance of it exploding while trying to dock on the Empire State Building. If it exploded while above numerous citizens, many lives would be in @CAPS3. The mooring mast idea, was now non-sense."
