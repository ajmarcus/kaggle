"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders could not simply just drop a mooring mast on the roof. It would add stress to the building's frame. Another problem that faced the builders was that hydrogen is very flamable. If a dirigible had been caught on fire and exploded, over downtown New York, then law suites would be made. Another problem that faced the builders in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building were the winds at the top of the building. There were shifting winds due to violent air currents and these winds would make it extremely difficult for dirigibles to dock. The last obstacle was the fact that there was a law against aircraft flying too low over urban areas.
