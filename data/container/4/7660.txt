"In the memoir Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez described their childhood home. The author creates a mood in this memoir.The mood is created by description of the kindness of his neighbors, his gratitude toward his parents, and how his house was turned into a home. The mood is created by a description of the kindness of his neighbors. Narciso talks about his neighbor hood, calling it ""a close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" Narciso is getting the point across that his community was a warm, loving place, where everyone was friends and there was no conflict. Narciso also talks about his gratitude towards his parents. He says that, ""They came selflessly, as many imigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it ment leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" Here, the mood is set as grateful, since if his parent had not given all that they had had, he would of been in a worse situation in Cuba. Narciso sets the mood by talking about his home. He says that, ""Countless extended family members came and went -- and there was often some one staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" This adds to the warmth of his home, giving in a warmer environment.The mood in this memoir is set by @PERSON1' parents' determination, the kindness of his community, and the open arms of his home. All of these thing are the definition of family."
