"The builders' expectations were set too high and they faced many obstacles they had not foreseen. Safety was a big issue in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable."" With a highly populated city like New York, it would have been easy for a fire to begin. Another obstacle of allowing dirigibles to dock was nature. The wind at times could be too powerful. As said the reading, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These threatening winds would have made it impossible for the dirigibles to land and serve as safe transportation.The last obstacle was that it was illegal. The had @CAPS1 been a law against it. The reading states, ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" With this law, there was not even a glimpse of hope that this plan could be successful."
