"The mood is shown and explained in several ways throughout the memoir. The mood of this short story is happiness and of a sense of family. The first example of this mood is in paragraph @NUM1 when the @CAPS1 says ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" @PERSON1 is showing that just because someone is not related to another person they cannot be family. Another example of the mood of the excerpt is when is when Narciso says ""My parents always kept to their arms and door opened to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" The @CAPS1 is showing that people who love each other like family have each other's backs, no matter what. A final example is when the @CAPS1 states ""I learned the real definition of family. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned about how to love."" The @CAPS1 is saying he is greatful for the people who showed him what ""family"" really is. In closing this story shows true family and how a house becomes a home."
