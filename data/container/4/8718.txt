"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"", by Narciso Rodriguez, there are several ways in which the author created the mood. For instance, when the author states how his family is from Cuba and they were able to move to a modest apartment.. The authors states, "" originally from Cuba could afford to move into a modest apartment I would soon call home"" (@NUM1). This quote shows, that the authors parents wanted to give him a good life. They did this by moving themselves and him to @LOCATION2. Another example occurs when, the author describes what his kitchen ""heart of the house is like and how even though they are New Jersey, their house still feels like cuba. The author says, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"" (@NUM2). This quote demonstrates, that the authors family made sure he still knew what cuba is like. The authors parents wanted to show him both sides of the world (cuba and @LOCATION2). Last, when the author says how grateful he is about his parents and the way he grew up. The author says, "" I learned the real definition of ""family"" I learned there how to love"" (@NUM3).
