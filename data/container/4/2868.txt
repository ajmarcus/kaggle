"When Al Smith first came up with the plan to use the Empire State Building is a mooring mast, he had no idea how obstacles they would face in a attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One large obstacle was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) The reason this is so unsafe is because if the gas inside ever happened to catch on fire, the entire craft would exploded in flames. This is a hazard to those in the ship, as well as those in the streets below. Another obstacle was the high winds at the top of the building. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) This was a problem because it would cause to the dirigible to move all over the place. The idea of using lead weights to weigh it down was proposed, but they would be a danger to pedestrians below. A third and final obstacle they faced was the stress a dirigible would cause on the building's frame. The building's design was not capable of handling the stress of a dirigible tied to its mast, without changing the design, the dirigible would probable tear the building apart. The only solution was to strengthen the building ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework,"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). That is a ridiculous amount of money they had to spend just to make it possible for the dirigible to dock. It is easy to see how difficult the project was based on the many obstacles the builders had to face."
