"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems in attempting to dock dirigibles on the mast. One major problem was that the original Empire State Building, ""...could not simply drop a mooring mast,"" on the top of the building because the ""...single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."" Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's frame work. One reason dirigibles were never docked on the mooring mast was due to ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air current."" This makes it impossible for dirigibles to even approach the mass without being impaled by other buildings. There was also, ""...an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This made it illegal to even dock airships on top of the Empire State Building. Dirigibles contain hydrogen which is ""highly flammable."" If the Hindenburg incident had taken place in New York, the accident would have been ""much worse."" These reasons contributed to the builders' problems, and explain why the mooring mast was never used."
