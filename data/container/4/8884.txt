"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the mood created by the author was loving, caring, and appreciative. loving is what they did most because they basicly called everyone thier family. For example in paragraph @NUM1 it says that ""My parents always kept thier arms and thier door open to the many people we call family, knowing that they would do the same for us"". Another mood was caring, because they wanted thier children to have a better life. A example is ""My mother and father had to come to this country with such courage, to give thier children a better life, leaving thier friends, families, and career in the country they loved"". This shows they care about thier kids. One last mood is appreciative. ""The barriers to work were strong and high, my parents had to accept that they both might not be able to find the Jobs they deserve, they had to start thier life over. These are the moods that was created by the author."
