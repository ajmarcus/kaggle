"I believe that the mood created by the author is happy and loving. In paragraph @NUM1 it states ""Growing up in the enviorment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" @CAPS1 not only the people blood related to your is your family but also friends and anyone close to you. The excerpt also states ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcome other refugees to celebrate their arival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays."" This shows the love that everyone has for one another. Lastly the excerpt states ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of family."" This part makes you feel warm and happy about family."
