"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of those obsticles was that many dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen instead of helium. This was a problem because, ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" (para. @NUM1). Docking dirigibles that use hydrogen not helium had been proven dangerous by the German Hindenburg when it was destroyed in a fire, and if anything like that occurred over New York the results would be horrible. A second obsticle faced in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was another safety consern. The point was brought up that ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (para. @NUM2). This would make it unsafe for the passengers on board the dirigible. A third obsticle faced is the fact that there was a law against airships flying too low over areas such as New York. That law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" (para. @NUM3). Those are three obsticles the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
