"Although there were great hopes for the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, many obstacles were faced while trying to reach this dream. One obstacle noticed while designing the mast to dock on, was that the height and weight of a dirigible would greatly add stress to the building's frame. This would then be transmitted to the building's foundation as well. This clearly possessed a problem bigger than the Empire State Building could withstand. Another reason that builders faced an obstruction in the hopes of allowing dirigibles to dock was safety reasons. One of the most apparent problems, was that most dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION2 were fueled by hydrogen gas, opposed to helium gas. This posed a threat, for hydrogen is highly flammable. Putting a densely populated area such as downtown New York at risk consequently came as an obstacle for builders. The nature itself came as one of the last problems for such a dream. Winds that were constantly shifting due to extreme air currents, at the top of the building could easily cause the back of the dirigible to spin around the mooring mast. Again putting thousands of people below the building, was neither practical nor safe."" As quoted by the passage, ""the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was never destined to fulfill its purpose..."", clearly posing many obstacles in allowing to dock dirigibles on such a building."
