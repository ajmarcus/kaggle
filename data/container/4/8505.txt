"In ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez a happy, loving and grateful mood is created. Narciso writes ""Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" @CAPS1 loves the people that @CAPS1 calls his family, even if they aren't really related. @CAPS1 talks about Alegria, his first friend, and Sergio and it Edelmira, his surrogate grandparents. Narciso aknowledges the fact that his parents left behind their old life and came to @LOCATION3 for him. @CAPS1 says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 knows that his parents care about him more than they can ever express. Narciso knows that his neighborhood was a huge part of his life and proves it by writing ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" I think that overall it is an upbeat article about a man's past, where she learned the defenition of love, and how grateful @CAPS1 is to those who taught him it."
