""My young parents created a traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen... My parents passed on to me... a love of cooking that is still with me today (for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air..."" @CAPS1 continues by describing how wonderful a place to grow up it was + how his parents showed him genorosity.Next, @CAPS1 says how hard it was for his parents to leave everything they knew, just for their children. In states in paragraph @NUM2, ""they came selflessly... to give their children a better life."" @CAPS1 continues by writing of how strong they were by showing him the value of family + friends + genorosity.
