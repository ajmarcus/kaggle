"The mood created by the author in the memoir I would have to say a loving mood because through-out the whole memoir Narciso Rodriguez talks about how loving and caring and selflessness his parents were. For example in paragraph @NUM1 it states ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" Also near the end of paragraph @NUM1 it says ""In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."" @CAPS1 are two reasons of why I believe the mood of the memoir the author created is a loving mood. Also in paragraph @NUM3 it says ""countless extended family members came and went- and their was often someone staying with us temporarily untill they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" That is the final reason of why I think the mood of the memoir is a loving mood."
