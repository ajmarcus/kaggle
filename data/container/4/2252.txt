"Based on the excerpt, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, the safety of the city and dirigibles were a concern. In paragraph thirteen, it states ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"". In addition, the greatest of obstacles was truly nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" As a dirigible attempted to succesfully use the mooring mast, the back end of the blimp would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". There additionally was a law which dated airships cannot fly that low over an urban area. Thus, the multiple obstacles which were faced through this ""architectural breakthrough"" destroyed any hope of the building's true purpose."
