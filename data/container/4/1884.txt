"In this excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem they faced was redesigning the building's original skeleton to fit the needs of the mooring mast. This can be shown when the excerpt states, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework"" (paragraph @NUM1). The workers had to change their first design to meet the mandatory requirements for the mooring mast. The workers also had to face the fact that overall, the mooring mast was too dangerous to use. This can be proven when the excerpt says, ""The greatest reason was one of safety... hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM2). The dirigibles used outside of the United States used a gas they created a dangerous risk for accidents. Another battle the builders had to face was the strong winds. This can be shown when the excerpt quotes, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (paragraph @NUM3). The winds caused the dirigible to move too much that it became unsafe to use. The builders of the Empire State Building were challenged with many obstacles while they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there."
