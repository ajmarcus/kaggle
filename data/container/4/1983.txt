"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph nine it states ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state buildings flat roof."" This obstacle was massive because in order to accommodate the new station over sixty thousand dollars worth of work would have to be made to the building. Another reason as stated in paragraph @NUM1 ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas."" This shows this was another major obstacle for the builders. Another obstacle for the builders is nature as stated in paragraph @NUM2 ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" this could be very dangerous. If the back of the ship was dangling over the streets surrounding the empire state building there could be many safety hazards. These obstacles were the main obstacles the builders had to face if the Empire State building would be a landing dock."
