"The mood in ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our lives"" is compassion. Throughout the memoir it talks about how Narciso was grateful to his parents for their ""love and sacrifice"". He was grateful that they wanted to move to the United States from Cuba just to ensure that he would have a better life. He learned generosity and how important family and friends are from his parents and they have been ""the basis"" of his life. His house welcomed everyone and the air was always filled with ""not just scent and music but life and love. He learned what family really ment and learned how to love. He loved his parents a lot and talked highly of them in his memoir ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love... The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."" That is why I think that the mood in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our lives"" is compassion."
