"One of the moods in the memoir was greatful. Narciso greatful to have parents who gave up so much to make a good life for him. Also he is greatful because his parents showed him how important family and friends are. This means that he was greatful to have parents who cared enough to give up things they loved for people they loved. Another mood is peaceful because Narciso loved the Cuban music they listen to. Narciso had people over all the time, the kitchen was always being used. He says ""family had nothing to do with being a blood relative. I mean his house was a peaceful and a safe place. Everyone was always at his house. His parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people the considered family."" the last mood I thought was happy. Narciso was always happy because his family helped so many people. Also he loved that his parents thought them so many things. I mean that he always had something to do. He was always happy to be around family and friends."
