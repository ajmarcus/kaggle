"The mood created in Narciso Rodriguez's  passage is loving and grateful. Narciso creates the image of a very happy childhood, while comparing her happiness to the hard work her parents toiled through and all the things they sacrificed for her. @CAPS1 often describes the feeling of closeness between her neighborhood and her family. 'In our neighborhood... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hard-working immigrants..' Their family consisted of a variety of people, not necessarily related, but there was always a helping hand for each other in the community in times of trouble. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" The warmth of her childhood life is expressed in the line, 'Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.' Narciso gives many examples of her happiness, but @CAPS1 always refers back to the hard work of her parents. @CAPS1 thanks her parents for giving her the opportunity to experience a better life. 'I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice...' I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love.' @CAPS1 feels very grateful for her parent's strife to help her and for such an accepting neighborhood. The mood of the passage is loving and grateful."
