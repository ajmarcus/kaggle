"The mood the author created in the memoir is very significant. He expresses love, appriciation, and unity. Narciso shows a lot of love not only to his parents, but to his culture. He stated often about how thankful he was to grow up around cuban food and music. For example in paragraph @NUM1 he says, ""...Passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today,"" and, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" @CAPS1 he showed appritation toard his parents. Narciso often states how much he admires them for their bravery by coming to @LOCATION1. He talks alot about how they turned their simple house into a home in paragraph @NUM2. Finally, unity was shown a great deal in his community because they were mostly all cuban, spanish, or Italian imagrents, and they tended to stick together. Overall, Narciso really learned what the word ""family"" means."
