"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included issues in safety, nature problems, and a dilemma with a law. Safety was a major concern as many dirigibles used hydrogen, which was highly flammable. An example of such a dirigible was the German Hindenburg, which went up in flames in Lakehurst, New Jersey. As the article ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted, states, ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it taken place above a densely populated areas such as downtown New York City."" @CAPS1, nature was a big obstacle the owners faced, as the winds on top of the building constantly shifted. According to Lsted, this would have caused the back of the dirigibles to ""swivel around the mooring mast,"" which would not have been ""practical nor safe."" @CAPS2, there were legal issues the builders faced. There was a law at the time restricting airships from flying too low over populated areas. As the article notes, ""This law would make it illegal for shipped ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" The builders of the Empire State Building faced issues with safety, nature, and the law."
