"The author in the memoir tried to create a specific mood. This mood is appreciation. He is saying all the things he is thankful for. ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly..."" In this quote he is thanking and appreciating all the work his parents went through to give him a good life. He is also admiring the things they went through such as leaving behind their families, and careers in the country they loved. He is greatful for the house he lived in and he looks back at the memories of them cooking in the kitchen again, with the smells of Cuban foods, and sounds of Cuban music. He expresses all of this in the last few lines of the memoir that state: ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" In conclusion, the author's memoir is all about his appreciation of the good things that came to him in his childhood, and the memories he will never forget"
