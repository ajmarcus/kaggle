"In the excerpt ""@CAPS1 Rodriguez"" from Home: the @CAPS2 of our Lives, the author gives off a very nostalgic mood. Throughout the excerpt @CAPS4 recalls all the feasts, parties and guests @CAPS4 had at the ""simple house"" his parents turned ""into a home"" as stated in @CAPS3 @NUM1. This tells me that the author had  very good memories at the house @CAPS4 loved and grew up in. The author also gives off a very compassionate mood. In @CAPS3 @NUM2 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.""  @CAPS4 describes his comunnity as ""close-knit"" and ""honest"". This tells me that the author was very similar to his community and loved all of them and was grateful his parents took their time to make his life the best they could. The mood is lastly @CAPS5. In @CAPS3 @NUM3 it says his community ""extended a hand to people who were clearly in need."" @CAPS4 calls his parents actions of coming to @LOCATION1 ""courageous."" @CAPS4 takes pride in his Cuban family and @ORGANIZATION1 and all of the immagrants @CAPS4 grew up around, which tells me @CAPS4 knows they accomplished a big feat in their lives. Those are the moods set by the author."
