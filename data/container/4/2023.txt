"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles, including nature, safety, and the law, when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders' first imediate concern was for the structure of the building. When moured, the dirigible ""would add stress to the building."" To counteract this added weight, the building would need to be modified and strengthened. The builders were also worried about safety after a German dirigible was destroyed in a fire. Since the gas used to keep dirigibles aloft are highly flamable and downtown New York is so densely populated, they realized this could be very dangerous. The greatest obstacle was the high winds on top of the building that, ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" With the dirigible tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would be swiveling in the wind. While lead weights could be used in open landing fields, these would be neither safe nor practical when hanging above pedestrians on the streets. Lastly, there was a law existing stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. This would make it impossible for a dirigible to even approach the building. The combination of these obstacles made it impossible for dirigibles to ever dock at the Empire State Building."
