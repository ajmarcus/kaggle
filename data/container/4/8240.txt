"The mood of this memoir is one of love and kindness. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hard-working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This shows how close and kind the neighborhood around the house was. The end of paragraph @NUM2 it states ""Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. The way that her parents helped the community out shows their general love and kindness for all. Finally, in paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house were a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was here that I learned the definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" It says right out that the ""scent"", or mood, is of love and that this is where he learned how to love. The mood of this article is very loving and kind."
