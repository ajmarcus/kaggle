"The mood created by the author in the memoir can be described in many ways. For one, the mood is of graciousness for all that was done for Narciso Rodriguez. In the memoir it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.""  This feeling of graciousness tells about the love and sacrifice he feels his parents went through for him. The memoir also shows this mood of graciousness for the understandings his parents taught him. In the memoir it says, ""Growing up in this envronment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative. This understanding that was taught to him had a large impact on his life at that time. The final express of graciousness in the memoir is his feelings toward the passions his parents taught him. In the memoir it says, ""unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally thankful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air,"". These express the passions and skills that followed the author to adult hood, holding a special place in his heart. These are the descriptions of the mood that is created by the author in the memoir. "
