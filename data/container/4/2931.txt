"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced was they couldnot simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. ""The thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. The second obstacle of allowing dirigibles to dock there was ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM2). Another obstacle they faced was the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (paragraph @NUM3). This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."
