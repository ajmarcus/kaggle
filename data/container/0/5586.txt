"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng failed to get a certain plant because it died but winter is over in spring is here it’s her chance to get that flower. For example in the story it says Saeng broke down and wept. It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. It’s not her fault because in the story, it says the wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remarks of green and chicory weeds. The concludes because it will be a next time when you see Saeng again with a beautiful plant in her hand."
