"In the story the author included that concluding paragraph because if you had read the rest of the story you would know that the person was talking about when she comes back that she wanted to take the test again because it would be such nicer weather then it was the first time she took it, another reason why I believe the author added this conclusion paragraph at the very end of the novel is to show the reader if they really did understand the novel and what she was really going for in the novel. So the author first wanted to make shore the reader would understand the ending of the book better with that conclusion paragraph at the end. These are the reason why I think the author added that concluding paragraph at the very end of that novel."
