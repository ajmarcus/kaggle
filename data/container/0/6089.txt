"There are many reasons the narrator could have ended with this paragraph. One reason it's the start of the winter so hibiscus won't return until spring. Also, its the end of the story so its a good way to end it because its the ending of the hibiscus and the ending of the story. The last paragraph also kind of summarizes up the story and its short and sweet. Which makes it a great ending to the story. Its not like most endings to a story so its unique. Because most stories arent about nature. In conclusion, there are many reasons the narrator could have choose to end the story with this paragraph."
