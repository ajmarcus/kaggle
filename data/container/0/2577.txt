"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the empire state building faced obstacles in attempting to allow Dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was when al Smith realized that he was close to Not winning the world's tallest building. It talks about it in paragraph @NUM1. Then he annonced that the building would reach 1,250 feet. That's an obstacle because without the building he cant make the dirigible, and he always wanted compitition so his building had to be the winning one and he had to build the dirigible."
