"The builders had many obstacles while building the Empire State building. They had competition with the Chrysler building because of it's height. Al Smith, the constructor of the Empire State wanted to build the tallet and most famous building in the world. He made the buildings seem invincable. He even put a mooring mast on it so things could land on it. But it was never suppost to surve that purpouse, It was only created for publicity. Because about the mooring mast the building would have failed to become popular. Al Smith did everything to make that building what it is today and it is still standing in New York city today."
