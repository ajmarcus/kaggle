"The builders of the empire state building had to face the obstacle of safety, to make sure everyone can get on the dirigible safely without any form of danger. Another obstacle is arranging the dirigibles so that they are able to board passengers from there. @PERSON1 said ""the height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gears."" People did'nt want to try it, so that would be another obstacle. If people did'nt want to try it then it will become just a decoration, and that's not what Al Smith wanted. Last obstacle would be that it would'nt hold for long as said in the excerpt ""The mooring mast on the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" In other words, the architects did'nt think to far a head into the future to see if the mooring mast would even be used. These are some of the obstacles that the builders had to face."
