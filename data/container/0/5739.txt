"The author concluded the story with this paragraph, When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The concludes the story with the paragraph above because it shows Saeng is a carring person to nature. I know this because of this quote, one of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. This quote show that she cares for the little things in nature. Another quote that show Saeng is caring towards nature is, she tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her other hand. This shows that Saeng is very caring to a small plant, which is part of nature. So in conclusion the author concluded the story with the paragraph above to show the Saeng is a carring person towards nature."
