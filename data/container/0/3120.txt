The emire state building faced alot of obstacles and challenges while it was being built. The builders built a rocket shaped mast so the dirigible could be housed in the shaft itself. Which also had elevators so people could go down to the lobby. The building would now be 102 floors. The glassed observation room would be on the 101st floor.
