"The author includes this in the paragraph to simply be sarcastic for you to know that it is almost impossible for Saeng to take the test afresh. I say this because she was being very sarcastic meaning she’s not going to take the test. For example, if someone were to tell me take a test and I said whenever @LOCATION1 is president again, then I’ll take the test. That would be very sarcastic meaning that it wont happen and I’m not taking the test, instead of just saying No. The author included that just to let you know that the chances of her taking the test is very low.
