I think the author concludes this party because he wanted to let the reader know that it wasnt it for the little girl and she wasnt going to give up on planting flower and that when the spring come and the snow had melt she was going to plant some more flower and see how they will do during the spring even though that it didnt work as well as the winter season she did let her stop her I think the author is trying to say is that if you do something and it doesnt work keep on trying maybe something different will happen.
