"The author wrote the paragraph because she went back in side the house to get a dinner and because aint going to see the garden until the other day and because the winter come and she will not play outside anymore until the winter goes. Like she said In the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. That quotation explain why the author concludes the story with this paragraph."
