"The mood created by the arthur in the memoir is to never forget what home is if you ever move away or you grow up and you move. its okay because you will have better memories there at your new house and also if you have the nastest house, you can always make it into the cleanest house it just takes time, and effort. Everyone can do it. It don't matter what you look like or anything, and what you house looks like you still are you."
