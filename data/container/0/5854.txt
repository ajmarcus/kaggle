"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author includes this ending paragraph because she wants to show that next time around she will be prepared and ready for the garden and the challenges it holds. This first time, she wasn’t ready, and she didn’t know about the winter hisbiscus because she never did anything like it before."
