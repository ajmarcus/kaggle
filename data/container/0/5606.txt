The author concludes the story with this paragraph. He was talking for bout ho beautiful was nutura. He also thought sense Saeng loved nutura a lot she was going to go back to school to finish the test when she could be home in the grarden taking care of the plant. That why I think the author dicide to finish with that paragraph it would probaly discribe how much he like nature.
