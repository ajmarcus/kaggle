"The author concludes the story with this paragraph, ÒWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt & the geese return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,Ó so that the audience has something to think about, it gives the story a little more of a dramatic effect."
