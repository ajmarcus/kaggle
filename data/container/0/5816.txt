"In the story ’’winter hibiscus by Minfong Ho, I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph. ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.’’ @CAPS1 is shows that you should fight. For whats right and what you belive in."
