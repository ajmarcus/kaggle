"I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. One reason I think is because shes concluding that the winter is there, and when winter is over, she is going to start flowering and planting again. In the story it said, the winter hibiscus was in the ground now,. So, now she has to wait for winter to pass by then the hibiscus will be starting to grow and will hopefully be alone by spring. So, that is why I think she concluded the story the way she did."
