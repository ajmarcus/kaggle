"The mood that was created by the author in the memoir is that. It means that she is a citizen in the united States of @LOCATION1 and she is a good kid in school. She is kind to others. She respect the reigion she is, she haves lots of hope for the furtiure. She has lots of family members in the story, that wha I think of the memoir. that what I think it means."
