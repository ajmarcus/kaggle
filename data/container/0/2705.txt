The Empire State Building faced alot promblems before it came out as an @ORGANIZATION1.  They scared that other people will destroy this Building.  So the reduced the dirigibles to dock there. They wanted their city to become a famous city and get more money. And other problem the some people didn't care and postpone to later.
