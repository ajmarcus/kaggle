I think the author concludes the story with that ParagraPh to say that he will @CAPS1 uP in sPring time when the snow melts and geese return. Also I think that the author like the setting of sPring also to see the sunny skies a geese floating in a @CAPS2. I also would like that setting because It gives me more ideas and it's a very lovely setting to be around. That is why I think the author Picked that ParagraPh to conclude the story.
