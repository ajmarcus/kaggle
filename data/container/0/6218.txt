The paragraph in the one of the main pieces to to the story. In the spring, when the snows melt and after return, all she say is is when the snow is gone and the grass come back, I will start planting again and she would be happy with it, this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that again, she went to put her plants up again and tests them to see how them over so she can do them even again. Saeng loved this plant so much that she cant wait. But when it does she is going to plant a lot. That what the paragraph is saying Saeng is going to wait so he can plant a hibiscus. However, since she came to United States she loved the flower that very much."
