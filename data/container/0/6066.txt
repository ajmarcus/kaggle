"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was taking a test. In the story there are some quotes to support my response I-I failed the test Saeng said. This shows that she was taking a test about gardening. Another reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the story was about spring, gardening, and the life of it to them. The paragraph talks about spring, and flowers. The daughter and mother live off of the plants by planting vetagables, and fruits."
