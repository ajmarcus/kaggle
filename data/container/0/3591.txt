I’m one of them people who does not care about it cause it does not affect me or anyone I know. It is a big deal to write people, some of them @CAPS1 blow stuff up. They talking on tiv and on the radio making all this stuff they say is made up. I don’t believe to I see it. That @CAPS1 not for black people because it has not did anything to us. We really don’t care about the affects of the cyclist."
