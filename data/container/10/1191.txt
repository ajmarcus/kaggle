"Letter to the @CAPS1 I disagree with the so-called ""experts"" that claim that computers could have negative effects on people. The idea that you socialize less with family and friends is a pathetic arguement. Social networking sites like @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 allow @CAPS22 with all your friends @CAPS4 and other online games help you met new people that could be hundreds of miles away from you! Twiter is good when you just want to say something quick like ""@CAPS5 to @LOCATION1"". @CAPS18 allows you to talk to friends, comment on their videos, and subscribe to them, plus it provides hours of entertainment without a fee. Computers also can provide fun games and entertain users. There are many free games, like @PERSON1, that have endless possibilities. @PERSON1 @PERSON1 (made by @CAPS6) claims to be the most popular @CAPS7 (@CAPS8 @CAPS9 Online @CAPS10-playing @CAPS11) on the web. You can level up combat skills: attack, defence, strength, ranged, and magic. Or you can level up skills like wood cutting, prayer, farming, fishing, mining, and cooking. @PERSON1, like most @CAPS4, has quests, with varying difficulties. For example, for one quest you have to kill a demon, but for another, just find a missing cat. There are over @NUM1 quests, and there are never fewer than @NUM2 people playing at a time. Some other notable @CAPS13 games are @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS14: @CAPS15, @CAPS16 of @CAPS17, @ORGANIZATION2, @LOCATION2, and @ORGANIZATION1. As you can see, the computer has an impressive list of entertaining @CAPS11 for all ages, not to mention sites like @CAPS18 or addicting games. Computers don't really affect exercising. That's a personal choice, so you have to choose between @CAPS2 or the basketball court. It's like saying that before we had computers or video @CAPS11 consoles, that a @CAPS20 board stopped kids from exercising. The computer doesn't actually stop us from exercising. It's our minds that do, and our judgement. If you have bad judgement, you'd stay inside all day tweeting and @CAPS21. With a good strong mind and willpower, you can overcome a bad decision and play sports or go to the gym. All it takes is good judgement. Just to recap what I've said, @CAPS22 is plenty on computers and there are many choices on how to do it. Many sites amuse us, and we should make use of that. Not to mention you can buy games like @CAPS16 of @CAPS17 or @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS14: @CAPS15 for your @CAPS13! Computers don't actually hinder exercising, all it takes is good judgement to get off that chair and exercise."
