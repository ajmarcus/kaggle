"Dear trained @ORGANIZATION1 reader, @CAPS1! Ah, I love hearing my computer thunk on when I wake up. Such a lovely sound. Some people feel the need to disagree and say computers are bad for people. But, I feel the computer is a magnificent invention. All that @CAPS2 will help improve hand-eye cordination, you can look up anything in the world, and you can even meet new people and keep in touch with faraway friends. The world is just a click away! What's this? You need to write a paper on how to play baseball and improve your pitching skills at the same time? No need to worry, you can just type that paper up on the computer! This is one of the many perks of owning a computer. @CAPS2 a paper is so much faster than writing @CAPS3 by hand. Studies show that @CAPS2 a paper is @PERCENT1 faster than writing @CAPS3 out. Even @PERSON1, and handwriting enthusiest, says ""@CAPS2 is so much easier than having to write! I type all my books proper handwriting."" @CAPS3's been said by officials that most hand-writen lovers are converting to @CAPS2 for better hand-eye cordination. If @CAPS3's used by the people that oppose @CAPS3, @CAPS3's gotta be great! Let's say your doing a project on panda bears, but you don't know anything about them. What do you do? Search @CAPS3 up on @CAPS4.com of course! @CAPS4.com is a bounty of information, serving up marsels of links for any-and every-topic. I remember this one time I had a big report to write but I didn't know anything about the subject. So what solved my problem? @CAPS4! @CAPS3's been proven that @PERCENT2 of information found on @CAPS4 is true. You know what else on the computer can help you with information? Just about any domain name on the web. Just type what your looking for, add .com at the end and @CAPS5! all the information you could need. Hm, what else can the computer help with? I know. Your friend that moved away, you can send her a message and get back in touch. Or, if you don't like your friend that moved away, you can meet new people. For example, @LOCATION1 is a sight designed to match people up for romantic relations. So maybe you don't like computers. Oh well, all I can tell you is that your missing a lot. Great hand-eye cordination, magnificent information, and colorful people like I said, the world is just a click away!"
