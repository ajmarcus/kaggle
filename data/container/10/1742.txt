"Computers can take a lot of a person's time, but there are also benefits to having one. You could gain loads of knowledge and make interaction with others easier with a click of the cursor. The computer is the smartest thing youll ever see. All the facts of life and the world are put into it. Think of all the knowledge you would have from reading articles you find on google.com and all the other search engines. Wondering what is the best way to get somewhere? You can also look at maps of the whole world and zoom all the way to birds eye view. There's your map with just a click of the cursor. Does your child have a question from school that even you can't answer? There are help sites that can show and explain how to do your homework. Or if your child doesn't know what the homework and their friends are busy and can't tell them, most schools have websites with information about everything in school. There's your child's grades with just a click of the cursor. Your late for a party and you don't have a cell phone, but your family has one computer and you know your friend will be on. You can just log on to your facebook, twitter, or myspace and tell them your running late. It's @DATE1, no one writes letters anymore; there's e-mail and instant messaging. Letters take forever to write and if you mess up you have to start over. When you type, all you do is hit ""backspace"" and you write over only your mistake. Letters also take forever to recieve, while instant messeges come, well, instantly! Haven't seen your cousin or just want to see them? Computers are being made with webcams, or you can simply buy a detached one. You could be talking with your friend and seeing them right on your computer just with a click of the cursor. Don't think that's enough? If you explored the computer, then you'd find it can help you with a lot more than just learning and interaction."
