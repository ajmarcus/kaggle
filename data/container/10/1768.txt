"Dear Newspaper Readers, @CAPS1 many hours a day do you spend on the computer? In this modern world, @CAPS2 @MONTH1 seem hard for you to tear away from that trusty computer screen and face life. Nearly everyone in @LOCATION1 has a computer, about @PERCENT1, and @CAPS2 is ruining our country. With all these hours wasted in the virtual world, people are lacking in exercise, leading to many problems. They are also avoiding nature outside, and losing contact with family and friends. I think that computers are causing way too many problems and peerhaps, with some consideration @ORGANIZATION1 my evidence, you could come to think the same. Statistically, the @ORGANIZATION1 is the most overweight country. One @ORGANIZATION1 the reasons? Hours @ORGANIZATION1 sitting at the computer replaces healthy exercise @CAPS3 are all spending our lives on the computer, and sitting and clicking is not exercise. The great lack @ORGANIZATION1 exercise is causing health problems. Not exercising can lead to abesity, which damages joints terribly. Then, diabetes developes, taking away from the quality @ORGANIZATION1 your life. Finally, there is heart disease, a top killer in our country. All this from spending time on the computer? you @MONTH1 ask @CAPS4 the amount @ORGANIZATION1 time @CAPS3 spend on computers is much more damaging than this. Every day is beautiful in its own way, and sometimes @CAPS2 is beautiful to us, in saying that beautiful to us (when @CAPS2 comes to the outdoors) is clear skys and a warm-temperature. These days come quite often, but what does @ORGANIZATION1 do? Glance out the window and go back to texting on that @ORGANIZATION2 laptop. Our bodies need this @CAPS5, @CAPS5 @CAPS6. @CAPS3 get @CAPS2 from the sun, and without going outside, @CAPS3 don't get @CAPS2. not traveling outdoors deprives our body @ORGANIZATION1 an important @CAPS5. @CAPS2 affects more than just our health, as well @CAPS7 inside on the computer keeps us from having expenence real experience. @CAPS3 learn things on the computer, but only virtually. What happens when @CAPS3 are forced out into the real world and cant really do anything? Everyone loves having friends and family, so @CAPS2 doesn't make sense why @CAPS3 would rather email them with trivial things instead @ORGANIZATION1 talking. Instant messaging doesn't really bond people, as conversations are planned out you have time to think, so the person doesn't know what the real you would say. This frays the bonds between people, and once @CAPS3 can't work together, even with family, @ORGANIZATION1 can't work together at all, and nobody wants that. Computers take away too much to be spending so much time on. Blatantly, they are bad for people. Not only do they effectively cause abesity, they fool us into thinking @CAPS3 can do things that really, @CAPS3 can only do virtually, and make close people come apart. @CAPS2's ruining @LOCATION1. A country cannot be by the sick, useless, and isolated. @CAPS2's time to step away from the computer and into real life before @LOCATION1 gets demolished by these effects computers cause."
