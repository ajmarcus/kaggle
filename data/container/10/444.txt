"Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I strongly believe that people should cut down on using the computer. Just imagine, more people outside and healthy. Less “cyberspace” bullying, and less burning of electricity. My first reason why people should spend less time on the computer and more outside is because @PERCENT1 of people that use the computer more than two hours a day are either at risk of being overweight or are overweight. Also, @PERSON1, from @ORGANIZATION1 says “@CAPS2 people believe that using the computer gives you benefits, but they don’t. They increase your chances of either being overweight or getting diseases such as diebeties. It’s imperative that the community takes action to stop this from happening. “In addition, my neighbor, @PERSON2 had to do a study to interview overweight adults and teenagers. @CAPS3 told me that @PERCENT2 of the @NUM1 people @CAPS3 interviewed said they don’t go outside and use the computer for about @NUM2 hours a day! I implore the citizens of the @LOCATION1 area to cut down on internet time and go outside to enjoy nature. My second reason is the less people on the computer means less cyberspace bullying. @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people that use the socializing websites have experienced more than @NUM2 encounters of cyberbullying also my sisters friend, @PERSON3, overdosed on advil so @CAPS3 ran comitt suicside because of cyber bullying. Someone had said @CAPS3 was ugly, smelled and should ""go die in a hole."" @CAPS3 didn't tell anyone about this. Luckily her mother brought her to @CITY1 @ORGANIZATION1 fast enough to be put on life support for @NUM6 hours. furthermore, if people cut down on internet socializing website than less people will be in danger of cyberbullying affecting their lives. It's excruciating imperative for people to use the computer for only @NUM7 or @NUM8 hours a day. My final reason is, the less time you use your computer the less money you would be wasting on electricity bills and spending more time on family vacations. Dr. @DR1, from the peabody museum in @LOCATION2 begs people to use less electricity and power on the internet so the environment can slowly rebuild itself to be what it was before technology and electricity was invented. In addition, @PERCENT3 of power used in todays homes is used on computers. Also my grandmother is astounded by what todays technology is doing to the environment and the people behind this madness or electricity. @CAPS3 believes that the less time on the computer means more time on family vacations and with friends. Lastly, it's extremly imperative that people stop using computers as much to help their health their self estem and environment. A case take action to stop using computer @NUM9. Thank you for reading my paper."
