"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 you know that @NUM1 in every @NUM2 @CAPS2 families own a computer? Computers can be helpful if you need to write an essay for school, but when it comes to family vs. computer the average kid will usually pick the computer. Computers are taking away family time, exercise privledges, and time spent on school on school work. ""@PERSON3, get off the computer and come play '@CAPS3' with us!"" @CAPS4 mom's will say this to childeren at least once as week, the answer that is @CAPS4 common is ""@CAPS5!"" @CAPS6 childeren from the ages of @NUM3 to @NUM4 would rather spend time on the computer weather it's playing games or talking with friends. This is on issue that needs attention. Families should start to spend more time together instead of hanging out in front of a screen. My friend @PERSON1 has a little brother that is always playing games on the computer. Whenever @PERSON1 wants to play hide and go seek with him he always finds a way out of playing with @PERSON1 play computer. Aport from spending time with family computers take away @CAPS6 kids exercise privlidges. One example is that last week it snowed and I wanted my neigbor @PERSON2 to come outside and have a snowball fight with me but, she said had to finish a level on a computer game and it was realy important. This proves that it takes away time outside alone with exercise. A walk in the park with friends sounds relaxing to @CAPS4 people except for @CAPS4 teenagers would rather talk to their friends using a computer instead of actualy spending time with them. Lastly if time is being spent staring at a screen. When does homework got done? I took a survey recently among the eighth grade and the results showed that @PERCENT1 of the people that don't do their homework are due to spending too much time on the computer. In my science class a boy named @CAPS7 never does his homework. I asked him why one day and he says it was because he was talking to his girlfriend who also never does her homework because she always has something to do on the computer. @CAPS5 time spent with family, @CAPS5 exercise getting done, @CAPS5 time to play outside, and missing homework assignment are alot to sacrifice for ""@CAPS8 one more level."" I you want to help me get childeren not spend so much time on computer, write on artical on this important issue in one of your newspaper and please consider my ideas."
