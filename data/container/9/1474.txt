"Dear local newspaper, have computers ever hurt anyone? I believe the effects of computers on people are positive ones. For one, computers let people talk and socialize, even if they are on different sides of the planet. Another effect they have is letting people work faster in businesses and other jobs that require mathmatics. Lastly, computers allow people to see far away places and learn about almost anything with a click of a button. Because of the internet, people across the globe can talk to each other as if they were neighbors. Lets say a friend or family had to move to another country or state. They could be apart for months or even years. They would miss each other contantly. But with computers, they can talk to each other like they were still neighbors. Computers also have some more ""practical"" uses. They make it easier to see their stocks, their income, and even see sale trends. Lets say you needed to make a change to the price of your goods but your car broke down and the incorrect price was miles away. You would halfway have to wait for a mechanic or run for miles to get to a phone. But with a computer, you wouldn't need to do any of that. Just log on and change the price from the luxury of your own home. There are also educational purposes for computers. Computers let you travel the world without taking a step. You could take a trip through the safari or go on an adventure in the raln forest. You could take in the beauty of the great plains or watch the ever changing sands of the sahara desert. You could learn about the greeks, archemedes, ancien egypt, or pacman, with a computer, the world is your oyster. That is why I see computers as a positively amazing thing. Because they let us do things our minds usually can't because they allow people to traverse the world in seconds, and because they allow people oceans away to talk together. So think, are computers really harmful?"
