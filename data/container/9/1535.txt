"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 personal experience, I think that computers have a positive effect on people. Many people enjoy their time on the computer because, with today's technology so many things can be done and quicker too. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 have a computer at home. I do and its just great. I got most things done and in a matter of time. I think computers have a positive effect on people because today you can do almost anything. For example, I have family in @LOCATION2; @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION4, and instead of calling them on the phone, I could video chat with them and it feels like you're actually there. Also, now you can pay your bills online, and instead of sending a letter through mail and waiting when it will arrive and having to buy stamps that are extremely expensive, you could just simply send on e-mail-free of charge. Most college students do their homework on the computer. They type essays, or while doing research on someone or something, they could just save it and take notes on it later. So basically a computer is almost a part of everyone's life and it can be entertaining, fun, and used for more important things. What I'm trying to say is computers are a part of every teenagers routine during the day. We like to interact with our friends and listen to music and bond with family and other realtives who you don't usually contact all on one piece of technology. Some people even go to school over the computer and get a degree in something. Computers are important, a computer will scan this test of mine and give me a score, so I think now you will agree with me now when I say computers have had and always will have a positive effect on people. Thank you for taking the time to listen to my opinion and I hope you agree."
