"Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Experts say that computers are ""taking over people"", I strongly disagree. People spend the amount of time they need and want then become active or spend time with family and friends. Computers allow people to learn, they allow people communicate to family and friends, too. Also, @CAPS5 people use computers for work and jobs. I believe computers allow people, like myself, to learn. You can learn also @CAPS5 things on the computer. You can learn about other countries, you can read articles on news, also. You can learn different languges and about the world. Online people can communicate with others. There is skype, which allows you to communicate with others while on the internet, you use a webcam. there is also instant messanger, or @CAPS3. @CAPS3 is like having a conversation with a person who's right next to you! Then there is email which can send letters, photos and comments. @CAPS5 people use computers for work. Microsoft @CAPS4 allows you to type stories and type letters. @CAPS5 people do job reports on @CAPS4. Also, the internet is helpful for work. Websites and search engines help you a lot. Websites can contain information that working people need. To finish this letter, I want to say that @NUM1) Computers allow people to learn. @NUM2) They allow people to communicate with friends and family. Lastly, @NUM3) @CAPS5 working people use the computer for work and reports. I hope I influenced you to see why computers aren't bad."
