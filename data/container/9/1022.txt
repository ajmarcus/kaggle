"You are the @NUM1 visitor, click here to get your prize! That is normal thing that will @CAPS4 up on computers, they can give you viruses, and people can get your personal information. That is one reason computers are bad. On top @DATE1 that, ""@CAPS1 @DATE1 computers more than @NUM2 kids are obducted each day!"" says @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @DATE1 the missing child agency. They get obducted @CAPS1 kids go on @CAPS6 rooms and get themselves into trouble. On another note we rely on computers to much, it not healthy for us. ""@CAPS4 up ads cause many problems,"" says @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 @CAPS5. More than @PERCENT1 @DATE1 people in the world have computers. This was from a world wide poll in @DATE1. More than @PERCENT2 @DATE1 that is kids. When kids are on computers they always click on the @CAPS4 up ads. These ads cause catastropic problems! Peoples computers get viruses, identities get stolen, and credit card information gets found out. Therefore with those things happening you are going to yell at your kids, but you can't blame them they just thought they were going to get a free xbox @NUM3. Now that I have told you about @CAPS4 ups let me tell you about chating. Chating on computer is just a bomb waiting to be set off. ""@CAPS6 rooms are the main why. Now that I have told you about chating let me tell you about how people rely on them to much. Instead @DATE1 looking up what a book was about, just read it! Everyone thinks a computer is the answer to every problem when in reality @PERCENT3 @DATE1 the things on the internet are false, says Technology @CAPS7 a magazine that deals with the disadvantages @DATE1 technology. I remember when I needed to know if my flight to @LOCATION1 was cancled, so I went on google and looked it up. The website I went on said it was cancled but later when I called the airport just to make sure it had been they said it took off when it was scheduled to! And instead @DATE1 an e-mail just send a letter! Do you want your kids obducted @CAPS1 fo @CAPS6 rooms? @DATE1 course not, and do you want to miss your flight for vacation? No I dont think so, computers are very bad and are used to often. No one wants their identity stolen @CAPS1 @DATE1 some @CAPS4 up ad. We need to do things on our own more often and stop relying on computers to do everything for us!"
