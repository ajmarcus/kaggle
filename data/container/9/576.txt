Computers do teach hand-eye cordination, let you talk to friends and family, and give you the chance to learn about faraway places and people.

It people, in shape and healthy @PERCENT1 of obeseity is caused by of the computers. Staying on all day sitting down rating. I think these should be a limit on a computer so people spend less time on the computer and more exercising. Most people dont know what it does to them but  time they get unhealthier and weaker. They dont know that sitting down for hars and hars eating a bag a chips does time. Once they start doing it, it because a habit and eating and just go on the computer for hars and hars. Not only does it decrease the time peole spend exercising it also decreases the time people spend enjoying and the Computers are addicting you go on for five minutes and you forget all what you do before you know it you have @CAPS1 hours. When people go on the computers they forget all about things they  do. Shopping going  with you friends and family. Enjoying nature  things and you that . It takes away your time that you can be going to the , going to stores restaurant the things you."
