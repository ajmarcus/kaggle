"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I think that more people should start using computers. They can offer things that just writing things down or a pece of paper cant, like being able to learn about things that aren't taught in school, you can talk with friends online and you can keep everything in one. The first reason I think more people should use computers is that they can learn about things that arent taught in. Such as current events, the history of our nation and how our government works. Now some people can argue that you can learn about current events on @CAPS1 or a newspaper. But the computer can give you the news in an article then show you it in a video. Also in my opinion the news from the internet is visually less condensed than on @CAPS1. Another reason I think more people should use computers is that you can talk with friends over the internet. This is great because there @MONTH1 be people you havent seen in awhile because they moved. I had a friend who moved to pitsburg when I was @NUM1 and when I got u @CAPS3 account I was able to find him and talk with him a while of him visiting. Or you can just keep in touch with friends that so to a different school. The last reason I think people should use computers is that you can keep pictures, videos, document and contacts on your hard time. This is important to because I am not very well organized when it comes to school. But I started using my book and started to some of the work on the computer. This helped me be less clutteres and keep all my work in our place. It also means you can email that walk to a teacher or notes a friend who might have missed school that day. So in conclusion that or why I think we should have peple we computers more. They can help you learn, let you talk with friends, or let you keep everything in one place. That is why I think more people should use computers."
