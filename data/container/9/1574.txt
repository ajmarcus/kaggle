"Dear, @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 I think that although computers are very helpful to socity. Thire also paseing a problem to it for example people are out there that adicted to computers and will in a dark area for hours just on the computer also its not helping the fact that there obessity in @LOCATION2 I explain that to you but any ways this thing that teaching are youth could very much hurt them. Computer junkies what are they? A computer junkie is someone who woke up in the morning at @TIME1 and and stay on it for a good past @NUM1 hours this is a problem that @PERCENT1 of are @CAPS1 youth have topic @MONTH1 be not be big to but it is a problem must know my brothers addict to his laptop he spends hours in his bedroom watching anime japanise cartoons and not eating anything the whole day. Never leaves his room and my mom get so tired of trying to drag him out of his room she just quit and it gets annoying after a while a little computer isnt bad but alot is. Obeasity is a growing problem in are nation and computers arent helping infact computers are making matters worse by having items being shiped to them of in extent of the obesse person getting up used and leaving of they could lose a little wieght and now you can order offline and have it deliverd to your door @CAPS2 @CAPS3 market such as @CAPS4 @CAPS5 domino @CAPS4 and @LOCATION3 jade have been a part of this issue stop online @CAPS3 ordering. The computer is a great way to learn about things but it also a great way to become a junkie and fat:"
