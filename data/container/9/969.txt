Computer are helping family chat with family and friends chat with freinds. It help peoples socialize by letting messages on paper that to be forever to deliver and to get one back, also if family members go away on a vacation you can still contact them. Or simply if a friend cant get a ride to another friends house they on still talk on the computer. Also a computer gives you an oportunity to socialize with people all over the world. Its amazing how easy it is to talk with other people with the computer. I really astonishing how much education we have gained from using the computer. Computers have given us to many part to learn. Before computers you learned about things from books, And many of those books could not teach you as well as a computer does. With a computer you can learn about space and stars and planets. Also with computers you can learn about other nation. What @CAPS1 culture and landscapes are like without even being @CAPS1. Computers have truly played a vital role in our education.
