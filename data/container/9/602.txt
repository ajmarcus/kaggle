"@ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 are many reasons why the computer technoligy benefits the society. For starters, the newspaper companies use computers to write the @ORGANIZATION2 paper. Personally, I believe that computers benefit the society for many reasons. Computers help with education, career building, and helps people connect with family. By readin this letter, I hope that this make computers appealing to you. One reason why people benefit from computers is how they help with education. In a poll taken at @ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of the students say that computers hel htem with their academic career. Also, many adults use computers for an education too. In the student body in class of '@NUM1 at @CAPS2 high school, most of the students quit school before they could finish senior year. @PERCENT2 of those students finished their high school and college years through online classes. Another reason how computers benefit the society is by helping with careers. At @CAPS3 industries, @PERSON1, the @CAPS4, says,  I dont know where our business would be if we didn't use computers. "" @CAPS5 to a poll taken by @CAPS4's of many high ranning industries, @PERCENT3 said that their business revolves around the internet. this could very well be the poll your @CAPS4 took. Finally, computers help families that are seperated, connect with each other. A marine said that he tries to contact his family as much as he can while he is at sea. If anyone deserves to contact their family that they haven't seen in two years, it should deffinately be the people in the army. In conclusion, the computer technoligy has benefited many people. A system that could regulate peoples computer use could be implamented but it would not make anybody happy. The changes could be made but, if anyone tried to take something important away, would you not do anything to stop it?"""
