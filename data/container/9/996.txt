"Imagine your life without the benifits @ORGANIZATION2 the computer. Do you think it would make life a little harder? Computers have positive effects on people for educational reasons and for a new way to develope @CAPS3 skills. @ORGANIZATION2 is very important to our sociotey. Computers can help with our educational needs. When a school project is going on more than @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION2 students use a computer to acces the information they need. I agree that students depend too much on a computer and not on books, but the computer has more information to offer than the average book. The computer @CAPS1 lets us, as students, to broaden our horizon. The @ORGANIZATION2 stated that ""a near @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION2 students learn something new from a computer that they did not already know."" @CAPS1, in @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 @CAPS4 a student could find more information on a specific country than they could with a book. I predict that as a result @ORGANIZATION2 the informational acces the computer gives us, that soon grades will boost at least @NUM1 to @PERCENT3. In a servey that was done by the @ORGANIZATION1, found that @PERCENT4 @ORGANIZATION2 students found more information, that was relavent, on a selected topic than in the whole school library. Next, the computer can help with hand-eye coordination for young kids. In school students are observed to see how well or if there coordination is being developed. With @PERCENT3 @ORGANIZATION2 students having very little coordination, computer games lowered the @PERCENT3 to @PERCENT5. The computer does help with the educational needs @ORGANIZATION2 students in @LOCATION1. The computer is a great way to socialize with friends. It is a new and inventive way to communicate. I know that some @MONTH1 say that there is less time spent humanly interacting, but on the computer it is still interacting. With a phone you can only chat with each other, but a computer has a webcam. This device allows you to talk to people with some human interaction. Around @NUM2 to @NUM3 million @CAPS5 have this device to use. It @CAPS1 is preinstalled into many @ORGANIZATION3 and @ORGANIZATION4 laptops, giving us portable acces to talk. CEO at @ORGANIZATION3 said that ""@CAPS6 the laptops have come with c built in web cam, one out @ORGANIZATION2 every two that have it installed use it to chat socially and for buisness."" The computer can help with our communications for @CAPS3 or buisness needs. The computer is a good way to start and develope with @CAPS3 skills. More than @PERCENT6 @ORGANIZATION2 children use a computer to start with the begenings @ORGANIZATION2 their @CAPS3 skills. Computer allow many people to become @CAPS3 with each other in new and effective ways. In conclusion, the average computer can benafit our lives in positive ways. From our educational needs and to our @CAPS3 needs, the computer positivley effets us in these two very important ways."
