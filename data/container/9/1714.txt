"Losing @CAPS1 to @ORGANIZATION1 are a huge part of daily life these days, which is good for businesses, and schools but for people just looking to pass time, computers are a dangerous choice. Yes, computers are a way of communication, and are helpful if a student forgets their homework or an assignment, but when it comes to boredome computers are bad. Social networking is scary in reality and too many young people are exposing themselves in making @CAPS2 or a @CAPS3 page. Also excersise is a big issue now and you aren't getting any by at a computer. On the other hand though, computers open up new worlds to people. You can type in any question or place into a search engine and instantly get results. Computers like anything else, are fine in moderation, but too much of one thing just isn't healthy. Websites like @CAPS2, or @CAPS3, or @CAPS6, are scary when it comes to privacy. There is very little privacy offered and your page can just be put out in the public. Also these w ebsites are addicting. You @MONTH1 just want to log on to check your notifications but you can end up on the computer for @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours without even realizing it. Other pass time could be running on a tredmill or jogging there dont have benefits. All you can get from an hour on the computer is blurred vision. It would be okay to be on the computer for 1/@NUM1 hour a day but not using to the internet. Websites can be a way to find computer time. Edline is homework or an assignment. Google is helpful for research or vocab work. When websites like these are the focus on computer time, it is much more productive. Overall, I believe that computers have a negative effect on people if as many people that use computers balanced that time with time to excersise, they would all be better off."
