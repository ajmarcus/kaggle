"Dear Local news paper @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1, I'am part of the middle community. I read or the local newspaper that lots of people use computers and that not everyone agrees that this benefits society. In @CAPS1 opinion this benefits society in many ways because you get to work anywere you want, you could connect with family, and because it gives you the ability to learn about other places and people. You can get to work anywere because now in this days a cellphone, and ipod's come's with internet and with many things that you need to work that you have in a computer. We also have the laptop's that are to take anywere. You also got many programs on a computer to connect with family on others states or city's as in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and @LOCATION1. Last, it also gives you the abiity of learning about other places, and people by photos, information, and websites. Like when it says the trategies that had happened in other states like the one that happened in @LOCATION4. This is @CAPS1 opinion why computers are benefit for society. Thanks for reading them and have a nice day."
