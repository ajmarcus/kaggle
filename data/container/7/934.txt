"Dear @LOCATION1 news paper, I think computers are a bad and good thing because computers keep some people inside more than usual and then on the other hand a computer allows you to talk with family members that you haven't seen in a long time, search for upcoming events and see if they are canceled and to search up other stuff like when a movie is playing. Computers are a big part of school too, because without computers it would be hard to study and for some teachers most of their homeworks aquires you to use a computer. There is some other things that are bad about computers too for example: my friend stayed on his computer playing video games for most of the day. Its like when he's on that computer he dosen't listen or hear anyone, not even his parents. He barely goes down to eat dinner and when he does he has his laptop right beside him. His parents started to get tired of it so they took his tv and laptop away so he could go outside and play with his friends. After a while he started to come outside a lot mostly every day when it was nice. They gave him back his computer and tv. The only time he goes on it now is rainy days."
