"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I believe computers and excelling technology benefits society because it can help with hand eye coordination, it will be an easy way to learn about faraway places and cultures, and your able to save and use your time more wisely. First of all every person needs hand-eye coordination, if you didn't you would either thore a ball in the comlplete other direction or you'll get hit in the face with it. Computers benefit childrens education too, they can help you discover and learn about far away places. For example if a student is studying @PERSON3 @LOCATION1 in their @CAPS2 @CAPS3 class, @PERSON1 in @CAPS4 class or maybe @PERSON2 in music class, instead of pulling out the old, dustty biography book it would be easier to look them up on a search engine. Lastly the computer benefits everyday working or stay at home parents because if you have to get in contact with a cetain person or business quickly you don't have to take the chance of having to go look in the phone book and the person or business isn't in it, just go to to @NUM1.com type in a last name or business name, so your all set. Also if your child is being a nuisance screaming and running around the house you can just set them up with an educational game so you can get your house-hold chores finished. Those are three of the most important reasons why I think computers benefit society. They are hand-eye coordination, learning techniques and saving everyday people time."
