"Dear Local Newspaper, I think that computers are giving bad effects on peoples lives. Instead of using your time wisely and getting active outdoors, your'e inside your house on the computer playing games or chatting with your friends. If you're those people who easily get overweight or in any diabetic medication right now, I't easily recommend you to do workout or go and invite a friend over for a walk at the park. That way you are enjoying nature, talking with your buddy instead of doing it online, and you'd also be getting exercise. If you didn't notice, you are also doing your friend a favor too. Not only are you getting good benefits on the outdoors but so is your partner. Getting more active @MONTH1 even bring your friendship or family bond even more closer. You might also improve your self-esteem because you'll look in the mirror and feel great about your new, healthy looking body. Also, if you're one of those people always depressed, feeling lonely, or just in a bad mood, this advice could be the key to your solution. The workouts and activities helps you have more energy you never thought you'd have before. if I were you, I'd stop being lazy and actually enjoy your life and not waste time doing lazy then go."
