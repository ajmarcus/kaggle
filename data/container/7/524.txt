"Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1 to this article more and more people use computers, and the people who support advances in technology believe computers have a posotive effect on people. I disagree on you part. I believe that computers can ruin your life, and make you go blind. Firstly, computers can ruind your life if. you stay on them for too long. Computers is a little device that can almost let you do anything on it. The computer can let you look ups where your friends live, you can play tons of games ect. I remember this one time when I was watching channel @NUM1 news and a @NUM2 years kid fainted from playing a computer game for too long. See, I told you that they can ruin your life all it takes is a couple of hours to like the computer. Secondly, computers can make you go blind because the screen of the computer is too close. The computer is built so you can do things on it, but unfortunatly the screen was screwed in too close so when you have to see something on your computer you literly have to stick your face on top of the screen. I remember one time when my dad bought a @ORGANIZATION1, my dad was on that computer all day and when he got off it his eyes were blood shot, the mont after that he got glasses. See, I told you stickig you face too close to a computer screen can hurt your eyes. In conclusion, the computer can ruin your life and can make you go blind. The computer is bad for you, so you should stop and think about what I wrote in this persuasive letter."
