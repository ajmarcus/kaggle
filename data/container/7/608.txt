"Dear @CAPS1 times, @CAPS2 people think that computers are good for socity but I do not. Computer's riskes out weighs the benighits. My first example is my father. My father never turned on a computer in his life and his buisness is doing fine. My father and his father has all of their records in a safe. One of my fathers friends had everything on his computer. When a virus hit it all of his files were gone and along with his records. My father handwrites all of his papers. He says if i need to type something out i'll buy a type writer. Also on things like facebook someone can see everything that another is doing. This is were alot of people pose as someone eles and thus @CAPS2 people get kidnapped or killed. A very good reason is that when people have alot of personal information when a virus hitls that person knows everything about you that you put on. For exampel i was watching a show on discovery channel when a man hacked into a myspace acount and used that persons name to people and try to create a cyder to the pentagon, that person almost got caught but never was. So you can see why my family does not like computers. My family is always at the farm or in the barn working on we have no time to be on the internet the only thing you need it for is school work. What ever happened to the old fasion way no computer, no problems."
