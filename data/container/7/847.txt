A computer to give the quier accesible information is do there project at home. Computers are great ways to meet people online so that you stay social and not. They also teach hand-eye-cordination. So you eyes are beter their seeing nothing. I also think computer benifits society because it could get student motivated in passing there test or passing the school year and getting the to use it. Computers are also a great of knowledge and can get kids to be better on a subject like history, or science, you should agree with me because local @ORGANIZATION1 papers got there information off the internet sometimes and with our computers @ORGANIZATION1 would be slow and.
