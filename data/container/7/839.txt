"Dear local Newspaper, Computers don't take exercising, enjoying nature, and no interacting with friends and family away from you. Your family can sey time limits on the computer if they think your. Spending to much time on it. If you have time limits then people will have a certin time they go on and off of the computer. For example a child is on the computer @NUM1 and you can't get them off, time limits will stop that. The child is on a game and if the time limits are on, when your time is done the computer logs off automaticaly. That way your child can't get back on till thier next time. The computer can do many things you can play online games and chat with friends. Chating will let you talk to friends over the computer and you won't need to call them. Online games will still let you talk to your friends but you can have an avatar you can dress up and be creative with. For example an online game can let you chat make friends,"
