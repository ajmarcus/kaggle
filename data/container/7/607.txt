"Dear Newspaper, I think Computers are a good effect in our lives. Some of the reasons why I say this is the good to use when researching has fun games and activities, and they keep you in touch with long distant reletives. First if you just been given a assignment for school or work you @MONTH1 have to type and research on what ever topic a computer is a great source of knowledge if researching something or even checking your bills, @CAPS1, Computers are fun they have lots of games and activities for you to play and do. Just think you sitting in the house on a rainy day bored out you mind and have no thing to do. Just go on your computer and play some game or just find some activities you whole family could do. Lastly, Computers are good to stay in contact with long distant family members these days all you have to do is get a web cam and hours it up to your computer and now its they our grandma, grandpa, cousin, and uncle, or who ever is right there you can talk to them like you were on the phone with no cost. In conclusion, as you can see after all I wrote computers, are good for researching, playing games or doing activities, and staying in touch with family I @CAPS2 in my house the computer is mostly used for the web cam to see my grandma in @LOCATION1. Well I hope this letter changed you oppinion on this great invention, the computer."
