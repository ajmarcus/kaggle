"Dear, I strongly believe that computers are great. There are a-lot of great things you can do on the computers. A-lot of people are saying that computers have bad effects on people, like not getting enough exercise and spending time with your family. I do not agree with that because say you have family in a different town, city, or state. There is a website where you can webcam people from all over world with anybody, so that is a good opportunity and also it is free and you can do it at anytime and if you have a laptop, anywhere! My next reason is that you get to see places you have never seen before with direct pictures, like on commercials when our familly wants to go on vaction to a far place and you know nothing about it. You can go on the computer and look up the place and see what it is about and also see what other people said about. Like if it is really hot, or cold, is it a good experience for kids, anything you want, the computer has it. My last reason on why computers are good is because of studying, one thing that always happens is I leave my textbook home. I can go on the computer and see what we had to do. Also you can use the computer to study and learn easier ways to do something for any subject. Surveys shows that @PERCENT1 of the kids who study on the computer pass there test and get a higher grade percentage +@NUM1. Also if a kid is studying and dosent know what a word is they can I look it up and figure out the definition and how to use it in a sentence. That is why I think computers are a great exercise for your well being and personality."
