"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I agree with some of the perfesionals that think the computer keeps people from exersising, enjoying nature, and spending quality time with friends and family. Some people thnk it's cool to be on the computer @NUM1 @NUM2. The truth is the computer with internet is like having @CAPS1 at your fingure tips, distractions, and more. You can find just about anything on the internet these days. Some people use the internet for doing homework. Sometimes people can find the exact answers to an assiment. That means they are becoming more dependant on tecnologie. If the world becomes more and more dependent on the of computers and such, that could mean things. the world is suffering because people are neglecting to pick up their trash and to try to stop @ORGANIZATION2. Most people, instead of taking action, will be on the computer. People are becoming more and more lazy these days. As I stated most people are becoming more and more lazy these days because all they have to do to have fun is sit and do little movement. Saying that, people are neglecting to exercise and eat right. They are also neglecting to spend time with friends and family. Instead of texting or @CAPS2 someon try to call them. Or maybe even wehn you're free you can go and make plans to visit with your family. Taht's all I ask is that you especially spend time with family because you can always get more friends or anew computer. But your cant get a new family."
