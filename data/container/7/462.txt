Whey people dont agrees to use the computer. First the computer we could use at for every thing like go to other place you want to visit. Then @CAPS1 you want to work or go to another school some you need to do it by computer. Why not try to use the computer. I know computer is a lot of money but sometime @NUM1 good to have it. @CAPS1 people are spending too much time on their computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. For example some family and friends are not in the same place and they cant see each other the could write to each other online @CAPS1 they dont have cell phone of house phone. Then @CAPS1 people want to enjoy other nature that they dont know the could use the computer and look for the place. The three reson is that people could do exercising trough computer. It dont mather @CAPS1 the spend a lot of time in the computer being people could be doing a lot of thing in the computer. Like student we do a lot of projet in the computer we search for any can or thing. So people think that compute is fun for them. Finally other people that don't agrees they should try it.
