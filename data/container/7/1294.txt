"Dear @CAPS1, I have recently discovered that you are debating the computeres have on people. In my opinion I would think they have a neutral effect on people. In this day and age computers are used for many things. Research, communication act. maybe the reason young people so much time in the computure is because they have a lot of home work on the computer, ""@CAPS2 this"", ""@CAPS2 that"", people don't relize to pass we have to go on the computure. And for adults when you work with big companies you work with people all around the world. Instead of fixing to all these meetings you can simply do it over webcam. Yes, I see your concern that people spend too much time inside on their computure but what about people who love to read or play music, they could spend hours upon hours practicing or reading. What is the difference? And you never know maybe being on the computure for someone is lik a sport for another. Computoras are just about anywhere houses, schools and even crime & medical labs. Computure or a prime source of the data base, of @CAPS4, criminal records and so much more. With out computures how could catch the bad guy or catch the cancer before it's too late. Computure are key in many things. in the end you could go all day about the pros & cons of computures. But there so key in major aspects today, the pros out weigh the cons."
