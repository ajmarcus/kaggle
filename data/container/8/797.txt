"Dear @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION2, local paper @CAPS2 @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION2 edioter of local @CAPS4 paper. I'm writing a letter to tell you about the effect of computer on people in a society. I think that computers help society learn and helps people to talks to others around the world. Computer help society learn about faraway areas of the world, to learn about the history of an area, and to study animals and habits unable to reach with out travel. Computer make @CAPS14 easier to learn about area that are hard to research like @PERSON1 and cliff of the @CAPS5 in @LOCATION1, @CAPS6 to learn about history of an area or cities of ancient @CAPS7 like @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION2 of @CAPS5. Help study animals species and the habits they could home like the @CAPS9 @CAPS10 or the hasin in @CAPS9 or the species call the @CAPS12 @CAPS13. Computer help society learn about all this. Computer also help people talk to other around world like you can hold a confeti on you computer when you are home, @CAPS14 is easier to talk and ask questin with others as you are on vacation, and you don't have to pay to travel to a place to have a confess with others. You can hold a confess on your computer from home when you can't make to @CAPS14. @CAPS14's easier to talk and ask question about something important to your business. You can go on your computer and talk with other people without spending money to travel there. This how computer help people talk with others around the world. This how computers help socity learn and talk to other around the world. @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION2 edioter of local newspaper."
