"Many people use computers. Some people agrees that it benefit the society and others disagree. Some experts think people are spending too much time on the computers, and less time exercising, playing outside, and having family time. I think differently, computers help us with hand-eye coordination for jobs, stay in touch with family members and friends, and computers also help us learn about different things. Computers help us with many things but the most important is jobs. Many jobs use computers. In order to get a job using computers you need hand-eye coordination which computers teach us. Computers prepare is with skills we are going to need when we get jobs. Computers are very helpful. Computers also help us stay in touch with our family members and friends. @PERSON2 @CAPS1 of @LOCATION1 says that if we didn't have computers @CAPS2 wouldn't have been able to see her neice and nephew open their christmas presents @CAPS2 got them. @CAPS2 also wouldn't have seen her nephew take his first steps. ""Technology is wonderful"" @CAPS2 explained to me. @CAPS2 loves staying in touch with her families through computers. Computers are also help young children to old adults learn new things. Computers hold a lot of information, many people learn things they have never heard of on the internet. My younger sister @PERSON1 learned how to read on the computer. @CAPS2 is in the highest reading level you can be in, in first grade. Computers are very helpful at learning new things. Computers can do many things, they help us with getting jobs by teaching us hand-eye coordination. They can also help us keep in touch with our loved ones. Computers teach us about interesting things like faraway places and people. Computers are a wonderful thing to have in our society. Experts, their is no reason whats so ever you should be concerned with more and more people using computers, it's a good thing."
