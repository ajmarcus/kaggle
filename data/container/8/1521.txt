"Dear local Newspaper, I was reading this article about computers. I agree with kids and adults not having time enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. But, also, kids and adults should be having some fun time outside and enjoying it. But when it comes to usage of computers is helpful for searching information. I think kids and adults need to get active and get healthy, because now kids don't want to play outside, so they can play outside, so they can play video games. When I was a little kid I would always play hide and seek but now my mother doesnt like to play anymore because of technology she rather be on the computer or on the phone. Kids all over the world now know how to use computers because they don't want to be outside. Computers are only helful when your doing a report or something, important. For example, people that have businesses they are going to need computers. Also when a teacher a sighs a project on someone your going to need a computer to search up information for that person. Finally alot of kids aren't taking responsibilty of school. They don't that school serious. Kids think that the computers will teach you everything well there wrong because things on the computer can be made up. But its also making there life very in healthy. So thats why computers are good usage and bad at time because kids don't play outside anymore and computer are helpfull for searching information so with. What I've sadi don't you agree with me?"
