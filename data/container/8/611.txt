"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people are using technology. A lot of them feel that it is helping and improving their learning ability, others disagree. I personally feel that computers are an advantage but also disadvantage. I say it can be an advantage because it is giving people a chance to experience above and beyond what they are learning. I say it is a disadvantage because a lot of people are on the computer and they don't get a lot of exercise. There are pros and cons to computers but manly cons. How long do you stay on the computer? @CAPS2 people find computers more entertaing than going outside and getting some exercise. Since technology is advancing, more and more people are going out to buy computers. A lot of teenagers are spending more and more time on the computer, playing games and going on their favorite websites. That is one reason why children from the ages @NUM1 and up are obese. They don't get enough exercise. That also leads into people spending time with your friends and family. I know alot of people like to spend time with their friends and family. But what if you were always on the computer and never made time to hang out with your friends or family. Your friends might ask you to go to the park with them, and you say no. Your friends are going to start pulling away from you. You might end up being lonely. Being on the computer constantly can ruins your life. If you are choosing the computer over other important thing, then I think we have a problem. Going on the computer all the time can became an addiction. I don't think people realize it, but it can. I can take over your life. I say this because when you have an addiction to anything, it is hard to stop. It is possible to stop all by yourself but thats rare. Majority of the times it is best to seek help, I personally think you should take all of these reasonings into consideration."
