"@ORGANIZATION1, In ones opinion about computers and what they can do to benefit society these days. Ones opinion about what the effects that computers have or people are that they can benefit us in many ways for example they can communicate with people around the world for example many people @MONTH1 have friends or family that live in another state or country computers can help us communicate with them. Commputers alow us to help us learn what we couldn't learn from books. Computers can help us with learning such as learning about or the population. One might think that is good but its slow with computers you can send emails and have the person on the other end reply instantly because of computers. Computers have benefited society in many ways. Computers in ones opinion about them is that they can benefit us in many ways we wouldn't think of being possible. Before computers and printers we had in use type writers and if you messed up you would have start again and it could take hours or work to get the paper perfect but with the worlds modern we would don't have to type whole paragraph over again if we make a mistake we can just hit the back space button on the keyboard so it won't take us hours to type one page or when it take half an how at most so computers have benefited us in more way than we know it. So in ones opinion about computers and what they can do to benefit us is that they allow us to do things we couldn't have done before the computer was invented. The computer was a great invention and it is benefited mankind as we speak and that it is that hard to set up. So in ones opinion about computers and what they do that can benefit the society that we live in and also benefit mankind as well."
