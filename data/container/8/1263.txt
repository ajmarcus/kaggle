"In my opinion i think computers have a positive effect on people. Computers allow you to communicate will people from anywhere in the world. You can learn about different places much faster than you would if you read a book. Also many more jobs want people with computer skills. It is also fun and educational. Can you imagine how much harder it would be to communicate with someone who lives in, lets say @LOCATION1. It would be a lot harder, dont you think? Well thanks to computers it is as easy as turning on your computer. Many teachers enjoy doing activities with penpals. That would be a lot harder if you had to write letters. It would also cost a lot more money to call. Also, if you were looking for specific information about florida it is alot easier on a computer. You just type in what it is you are looking for, rather than reading through tons of books, in which case you might not even find what you are looking for. Also the computer has millions of iinformation. The computer also has various pictures which is also good. Another good reason is that many more jobs these days want to hire someone who knows how to work with computers. You can do a lot more things on a computer that you cant do on a piece of paper. For example make animated movies and video games. These things have evolved over the years thanks to computers. Finally my last reason, its not only educational its also fun. Sure you can research information and do you rhomework on the computer, but you can also play games. Computers can do all sorts of different things. Computers can be programed to have simulations for jobs like policemen ambulance drivers, and doctors. These are all things that save lives. That is why i think computers have a positive effect on people. Without computers our country probably wouldn't be as evolved as it is today."
