"@CAPS1, @CAPS1 boom, bom! Those are the noises of pinball on my computer. @CAPS2! Yea we won"". Those are noises you don't want to be hearing all day. Always being on your computer is bad for your health. @CAPS5 you are a computer freak you will become overweight, it's bad for your eyes, and you can't enjoy beautiful nature. ""@CAPS3 you want to be so heavy that you can't even lift yourself out of bed? I don't think so. @CAPS5 you are always sitting at the computer desk then you might be like that. @PERCENT1 of doctors say that @CAPS5 you don't get up from the computer desk you will become obese! Being obese is terrible for your health. It can take years off your life. @CAPS5 you want to live a long healthy life you need to get up from the computer and exercise. ""@CAPS4 I think I need a stronger, my eye are getting worse! @CAPS5 something like this has ever happened tp you it's because your your eyes to at the computers screen all day. @PERSON1 says, ""@CAPS5 you are at the computer all the time you will need glasses or a stronger."" @CAPS6 and children need to get away from their computers. studies show that more adults are on computers, playing games than children. Have fresh, healthy eyes and get away the computer. The acroos your chill. in your right ear. The sun giving you the most beatiful tan. @CAPS3 you like the sound of this? Take away from your computer and go outside. This is the amazing experience you can get from going outside. @CAPS5 you sit at the computer screen maybe you can watch someone else enjoying the great, relaxing experience you shoud have. Get up, get active and go outside. Now is the time to get up from your computer. @CAPS5 you haven't learned, the computer is an unhealthy thing for humans to use. Be like me and get rid of your computer. You need to be healthy and most of all active. Have good eyes and enjoy nature. Don't use the computer."""
