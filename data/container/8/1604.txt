"I think that computers are because you can have arthridis in your finger, loss of vision, and you also should go out side to get fresh air. It is not good to sit on the computer. Because you can get arthrits in your fingers. There is also a deises called carpel tunnel that when you can really grasp anything anymore. My grandma has arthrites in her fingers but it is not from the computer it from doing dishes all the time. But when she does somthing she complains that her fingers hert. So I think @CAPS2 she is doing dishes I think the key bored will do much more damge and will effect you for the rest of your life. My mon always tolled me that @CAPS2 I sir in front of the @CAPS1 to long I will go blind. Well in a magesen it said that ""@CAPS2 you sit in front of a @CAPS1-computer for to long it will parshel blind you. so @CAPS2 you sit in front of a computer doing face book or somthing whats the differents that will parshel blind you. It is good to go out side somtimes to get fresh air or go for a walk those are someways to stay in shape because @CAPS2 you get obeses then you will die @CAPS2 all you do is sit in front of the computer you need to get exercise every day to stay fit and health that is the way to be in stead of eat junk food and drinking soda. In sure it's ok to go on the computer @CAPS2 you look up other health stuff to do. What im geting at is it is good to go on the computer somtimes but it can be very unhealthy to sit infront of it. @NUM1 you need to be healthe to stay alive and @CAPS2 you sit infront of it all day then the results wouldn't be good. Those are the resons why I think the computer is bad to sit infront of all day."
