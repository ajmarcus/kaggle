"Dear Local Newspaper, I have been using my computer for a long time now. I didn't have one growing up, but I got one last year. Ther has been people saying tht the computer is good and it helps you stay in contact with friends and family it helps you learn about everything and you can look up the news. I totally agree with this. But some people don't like the computer because they spend more time on it then going outside. Here are ny thoughts on the computer. First of all, teh computer is a great way to look up the news. You can find more news and weather faster then you can on teh television. if you want to find the news, just got to awebsite that you think has news. I am find out what weather is today, what happens throughout the day that @MONTH1 be shocking to everyone, and find out about celebrities. All this at a push of a button, and a click of the mouse. Secondly, the computer is like a tutor. Either your having trouble on homework, or you just want to knoe a simple fact, the computer is for you. Just search up soemthing you want to know on a search engine and you will have your answer. This amy not seen that important, but it is when you are anxious to learn. Lastly, the computer is the famous way of communicating around the globe. Whether it's facebook, myspace, aim, you can tlak to your distant or close family and friends. You might think, ""oh tha's what a phone is for""? Well all of these websites are free. Yeah, I said it free. There is also skype. Skype is where you can actually see the person you are talking to. Yes, the wonderful world of technology. So now you know that a computer can teach you things. it can find you news, and it can help you communicate across the globe. Now your thinking, ""People spend too much time on the computers right""? This is where independnece comes in. Get off or it. it's your decision to stay on it, not the computers. Limit your time to a half hour a day. Go ourside, enjoy nature. AMybe do a little excercise. "
