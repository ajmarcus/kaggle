"Hi! I am writing in which computers are a bad thing to the society or good thing. I think that computers are good thing to have around. They help us in a lot of way and they also help us find new friends and new updates. This is going to be my first opinion. I think that computers have effects on the society in a good way because people can find @CAPS1 of the latest updates on the weather, society and country's. It helps the society in a good way because people don't have to look though an old Newspaper. All they have to do is click and there there reading it all and probally seeing pics and stuff of it. This is my second reason why computers are a good effect on the society they help us in a lot of ways on which meeting new people and staying in close good with them and talking with them and sending pics of stuff and you. My last opinion for computers are a good effect on society is that @CAPS2 you have a buissness or anything you can sell any of your merchandise, keep buiness plans, And also you can make a website for your business after a while @CAPS1 of people will know about it and it would make a really big inpack on your buiness. That was my three opinion on which why computers are good effect on the society and I think that computers are really good effect on the society."
