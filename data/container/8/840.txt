"@CAPS1. The computer is a wonderful thing! However the effects it has on people can be bad. Think of it this way, it has magnetic forces that pull people to it and keep them @CAPS3 for hours. These magnetic forces keep people from exercising, stops them from spending time with family and friends and most importantly if they aren't being careful they can get into some cyber danger. I spoke with the @CAPS2 of @PERSON2 and he said @CAPS3 are so many people on their computers, people aren't getting enough exercise!"" @CAPS4 people dont get enough exercise their bodies expand and become obese. This happens a lot to average people. The @CAPS2 and I thought up some great ideas while I was @CAPS3 and we think for one week in @DATE1 we are going to live without any electricity! Computers are very use-full, they help spread important information around fast and make it easy to talk to friends and family. Even though you are talking to them you are not learning any new social skills. Typing on the computer is a lot different from talking in person. Usually you would type ""u"" instead of ""you"" or ""r"" instead of ""are"". Talking over the computer is great!"" says @PERSON1, ""But actually seeing my family and talking talking to them is way better."" @CAPS6, @CAPS7, @CAPS8, and way more sights websites can put you in cyber danger! Cyber danger is @CAPS4 you get in trouble on the computer. This can happen @CAPS4 you put up bad pictures of yourself or other people, @CAPS4 you talk to someone you have never met before, or you say something really mean to that girl you don't like. Those situations can all put you in a really tough place. Even if you have a webpage and you put it on private @CAPS3 is always a way to get in. @CAPS3 is also something called cyber bullying. Cyber bullying is @CAPS4 you get bullyed or are bullying another person over the computer. Don't think that no one will know @CAPS3 are ways to track down coversations between people. I really hope you all take this into account @CAPS4 you think about sitting at your computer! Go outside, spend time with your family and friends, and be careful from cyber danger! ""@NUM1"" bye!"""
