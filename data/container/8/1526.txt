"To: @ORGANIZATION1 goes so fast, and the most they make more new invations. They had invented a computer which it helps people in the work they have to do, however there is a big problem, is that people are spending too much in the computer specialy teenagers. I suggest that is a horrible idea, because they are less time being active, also less time intracting with friends and family and @CAPS1 it is dangerous for teenagers. However many people @MONTH1 not ogrea with me. There is so many teenagers and adults that are just wasting time in the computer, instead of playing outside enjoying the nature, doing exercise and just having fun. Don't you think is a great idea. Well a friend of mine used to go outside everyday went outside to play. I think . Which I really miss her. You know when you go spent time with your family. But guess what they are in the computer, wasting time instead of spending time with your family. Do you think thats good? Well is not because thats how the family gather and stop coming to visit you. That's just so sad had family seperate. That's not all because do you think that people will be in dangerous problems, well they are. Do you know how you get a myspace and you meat a boy that says that is the name age as you and tells you if he could meet you and you say yes and lets say you were @NUM1 year old girl, he is like @NUM2 years old. He will abuse of you or kill you. You thought he was @NUM1 years old but he was not. I think is dangerous for kids. I think is a horrible idea of having computers, because you will be less time spending nature, also less time spending with your family and getting into dangerous things. However people @MONTH1 not agree with me, but what if your child was in dangerous. How would you feel? People should really think about having computers."
