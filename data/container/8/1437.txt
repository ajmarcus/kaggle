"Dear local nepaper, I have reacently heard about the idea of computers are not very productive. Sure, people get informatin and talk online, but that can be a bad thing, I agree with computers being overcused and used for the wrong reason. To me, the main source of communication is chatting online. Even I talk online all the time. Chatting online is also a terrible thing if you abuse @CAPS1. Children aroung the world talk to people they hace never seen. People are being abroad because they believe the person they are taking to is the real deal, @CAPS1 is a great way to communicate just not in the wrong ways. Plagourism is happening all over the world, People just take whatever they want, when they did not create @CAPS1. We take if you are caught doing @CAPS1, you can go to prison. Although there is a way we van help the plagorism. the internet has all the information in the world, and people abuse @CAPS1. I have seen papers that have information that they copred and passed @CAPS1 to their paper. You can tell because @CAPS1 is a different for than the others, and bad things happen. Teachers immediately you have to talk to a supervisor about @CAPS1. I know I will try my best to not playorise, I can start by getting my own information. Everyone loves computer and technology, but if everyone can just lay off the computer for a while, things like plagorism and the abuse or online chatting can be limited. "
