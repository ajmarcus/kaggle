"Dear editor of The @CAPS1, I believe that computers are good ideas for our community. If the library's closed and a students needs information, you can look it upon the internet. Also, you can talk with your friends if your phones not working. Computers can help people learn about the latest news if the television is getting pixecl. First of all, computers can help with research alot. Let's say it's ranning healthy, your car? out of gas and you need to go to the library before it closes. Just be easier to go on the computer and find a research site about your topic; no gas wasted, no sopping wet doing just you in a robe sipping hot choclate on the computer. Next, you can talk to friends all the way in another country without having to pay extra for a long distance call. And if yo udon't have unlimited minutes and you went to talk with someone for a long time, you'd be wasting valuable minutes and money! This is where computers come in. You can just open a chat window and talk away, just like that. Finally, you can look up the latest news and information on a search program, like @ORGANIZATION1. If your television broke and it'd take a week to fix, what if something happened that you needed to know about you could just go on the internet and look it up. Thank you for reading my ideas, editor. I hope you'll choose my article to post in your newspaper when the time comes."
