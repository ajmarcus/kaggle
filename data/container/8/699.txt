"@ORGANIZATION2, Technology has developed majorly these past decades. It has helped mankind so much from buildings to new inventions. These is how ever a growing concern about whether it's beneficital or not? People become more lazier because of the many things you could do with it. I think that it benefits us all. We have learned many things from it. The computer shows what man kind is capable of doing. We can learn about many cultures with it. Students use it for studying and making projects look better. I asked @CAPS1 @PERSON3 of @ORGANIZATION1 about the concren. He says that is can expand our knowledge. There is concern about how much paper we lose every year. With computers it makes going green more possible. You can make powerpoints on the computers instead of using so much paper for long essay. We could do tests on computers. I think the future will be based everything on computers. You can email instead of using letters. For example my friend @PERSON2 said her school didn't use paper and uses computers. They saved money and paper because of powerpoints etc. I miss my family over at @LOCATION1. I want to see them. Not just by talking on the phone. I use the computer to talk to them basically have. I asked @NUM1 people if they perfer using computer to talk to there family or use a phone. @NUM2 out of @NUM1 said they perfer computer. I know I'm trying to they are great but they do have there down side. The games are horrible for the computer. People will just play and play all day long. Online for the games make it even more fun thus it make them lazier. There are so many games for the computer it's horrible says @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION3. In conclusion, computers will be something that will help us for a long time and it benefits us. Except the fact about the games I agree with that bad side. I hope I have shown you as an independent person my statement was true."
