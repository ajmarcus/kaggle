"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Some people @MONTH1 thingk that computers are helping our society, but I disagree. People who are sitting on the computer are not getting exercise or seeing beautiful nature. Do you want to get fat sitting next to a metal box? People are also not visiting friends and family and those are the most important. People in your life. Do you want to be the one sitting on a coputer all day getting fat or do you wan't to be physically fit while getting exercise. The only workout your getting on the computer is your fingers. So you should be getiting off your lazy bum, bum and getting some good old exercise. Yes computers teach you things, but exercise teaches you you things while you are getting fit. Who wouldn't want to see the beauty of nature. Yes you can see pictures of nature on the computer, but those are just a bunch of pixels mushed together. In the real world it is all natural and sometimes more beautiful than on the computer. How doesn't that sound better than the computer. All of the cool, fit people are outside enjoying nature, so be one of the cool people and go outside and have yourself a ban looking at exotic plants and beautiful animals. You can do both of those with your friends and family while sitting on your computer you don't see them as much @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 love their family and friends and I bet you are one of them. Friends and family can also help you get through hard times without them whi knows wgere you would be in life. So do yourself a favor get off the computer, and go visit some really great people. Its now or neve to get off that computer or your family and friends are going to leave you and you are going to get fat on top of that. Do you want to be that person? You are also going to miss out on the beauty of nature. So go, go, go, have yourself some fun."
