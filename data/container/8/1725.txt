"Computers have gotten more advanced over time. They have even gotten smaller and smaller, and yet people still don't understand the dangers that computers have on society and their personal life such as; stress, addiction, and cyberbulling. I am here to write about how computers are a nuisense in our lives. First and for most, computers are one of the laeding causes of stress in daily life. About four out of every ten people that are stressed are stressed out because of their computers. For example, if you were writing an important document or sending an email to your boss about work and your computer suddenly crashes, would you be upset? Would you feel like you want to rip your hair out and throw that computer out the window? I'm pretty sure that you would because your data is lost, you will have to restart your computer and, worst case senerio, take your computer to the electronic store to get it fixed. Another cause of stress is if someone hacks your computer by uploading a virus. Hacking was @CAPS1 become a world wide sport. There are books and instructions on how to hack a computer and the government can't do much about that since the first amendment gives you the write to publish what you (freedom of speech and press). Just look what happened in @LOCATION1. A computer hacker hacks a computer and shut of power to an entire city for about @NUM1 days. Also if someone upload a virus into your they can take all of your personal information, like your social security number. These two factors will cause major stress in you daily life. Secondly, people spend too much time on the computer at home. A recent survey shows that six out of every ten teenagers spend more that two hours on the computer. This make them less social meaning they won't spend time with friends, family, or even try out for sports. They won't get the recommended one hour of exercise a day."
