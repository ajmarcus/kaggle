"I think computers are very benefical. There are so many uses! From learning, to games, to videos, and to a tool that is very useful. Without computers we would be like the @CAPS1 (@CAPS2 offense any @CAPS1 people). We would have to wait for a news paper or the news to come on @CAPS4.V. to see becalling news. Let me explain my reasoning in the next few paragraphs. First and foremost, there are lots of things to do. You can play online games, off-line games, surf the web, chat, match videos, and so on and so forth. Without the internet I probably would have lost my interest in @ORGANIZATION1. I now am a member of the online community called www.MOCpages.com I post my creations, look at others creations, and comment, and chat. I use the internet to reasearch for school projects. Right now, I am reasearching @CAPS5 @CAPS6 during the @CAPS7 @CAPS8. Normally I would have to slave over books to find something. Now it is much easier, because keywords are matched. Finally, it is a good fool. Did you know the millitary needs computers to store info, attack, keep record, and to pilot certain planes? I need to use a computer to type up home work, because as you can see, my hand writing isn'@CAPS4 the neatest. Also, I stay in touch with my dad, who works in @ORGANIZATION2. I hope I persuaded you on my position. Remember computers, do lots of things, help us learn, and they are a fantastic tool. Thanks for reading, bye!"
