"@DATE1 @CAPS1 Local Newspaper, I think that computers have a huge affect on people. My thing about it is that the computer gets kids lazy and unactive. Having a computer will give kids the action to sit around and do nothing. I'm sure you've heard of websites such as myspace, facebook, formsping, etc. These websites can get a person to be willing to be on computer instead of exercising and staying healthy. I believe kids like me these day want to keep in touch with their friends. If the phone's not in the picture then the computer is. Also getting rid of the computer can stop the homosexuals from getting a hold of kids by acting their age. I will admit the computer can be useful but to be on all day that's just rediculous. I have a @NUM1 year old brother that stays on the computer from the time he gets til the time he goes to sleep. Compared to me he's not fit and healthy at all, that's what countless hours on the computer did to him. In fact he's on myspace so much that he has over @NUM2 friends and he doesn't even half of them he gives them his number and home address. Do you notice a lot of kids these days want to. can when you would rather waste the computer other than outside and at least self. I've always had a to football but I could @CAPS2 find the time to play with my brother. All they are about is chicks and of course the computer. I'm not asking to take away computer's in people's homes but put a stop to the daily number of hours spent on it because time is one thing that money can @CAPS2 buy. Some kids will look back to these days wondering how much time they wasted on nothing. long story short like life, dont spend it all on nothing."
