"Dear Local Newspaper, People all around the globe are using computers! Some people think this is a bad idea but I disagree. I believe that computers do have a positive effect on a persons life style. Computers help people stay in touch, computers are only getting better and they help kids in many ways. Computers definitly help people keep in touch. There is @CAPS1, myspace, twitter, facebook, email, and even video chat. For example, my cousin is in @LOCATION1 a sometimes we will go on the computer and talk to on video chat. Without this, we would have no communication with him. Many people around the world use computers to communicate. This is how people use computers to stay in touch. Also, computers are amazing now and they're only going to get better. If computers are so great now, just imagine what they will be like in @NUM1 or @NUM2 years. Plus, the more people buy and use computers the more company are going to want to invent new ones. As you can see computers are only going to get better. The last reason I would like to share with you today is that computers help kids tromendously. On average, about @PERCENT1 of kid in the @CAPS2.S use a computer every day. Kids use it to talk to friends, play games, do homework and to do many other things as well. Also, kids and adults just use computers if they need to know how to do something or even find places in their town. This is how kids are helped out by computers. As you can clearly see, computers are used all around the world for many different reasons. They help to stay in touch, they're only going to improve, and the help kids. Everyone is using computers, shouldn't you?"
