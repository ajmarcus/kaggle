"Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 people in the world use coumputers, we all know what computers are used for like surching the internet, games, work and school. Some people think that computers are good to use to help teach hand eye coordination, learn about other places in the world and talk with other people online. I am in @NUM1 grade at mystic middle school. I think that computers are not as good as some people think. Have you ever heard of computer camps. This is where some kids go because they are addicted to the computer. At this camp the kids are pulled away from the computer and pritty much forced to join gropes that do activitys like fishing or working together to solve a mystery. This camp is pritty much known as reliable for kids that are addicted to the computer. Another reason that computers are bad is because of the internet. The internet is a very dangerous. Place because you can chat to people that you dont even know. You never know the people could be messed on in the head. And try to find @CAPS4 where you like and come. you so you always have to be carful who you talk to other wise you could get. Nothing eve really goes right with computers, there alway getting slower and slower every time you use it. About every two years a kid or parent could go throw a computer. Also your computer doesn't have the right @CAPS3 it could get a vins and cost a person a few hundred dollars to get it fixed. Any thing could happen at any time with your computer, @CAPS4 of no where it could just die and not work and @CAPS2 of your data will be gone forever. Now that I have explaines my part of computers people will think different. Would you want to end up like one of those people, that are in a camp because they are on the computer to much. Or you never know you could forever and never be found. I alread know @CAPS5 much it is for coomputers to get fixed, but you might have to find @CAPS4 the hard way. That is why I think that computers just cause more truble for peolple."
