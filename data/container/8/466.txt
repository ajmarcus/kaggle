"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I've heard reports from both the news on @CAPS2.V. and your paper that more and more people are turned in to nothing but their computers. I'm not saying it's a bad thing I mean the computer has the internet which allows you to go to anything like websites and online chatting. I just think that people should get outside more often and do some outdoor things like football, basketball, baseball or if you're an adult you could get a job that doesn'@CAPS2 require a computer like for example building houses for homless people, shelters for animals, or have a job as a maitnence man, pool lifeguard, or any other job at a hotel that doesn'@CAPS2 involve a computer. You could work at a restaurant that has regular food or fast food service. Something that does'ent involve a computer. But if you can'@CAPS2 get out of the house you could do something a little different from computers video games. They maybe similar to the computer but they are something you can do on the @CAPS2.v. and it beats playing on the computer all the time."
