"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1 the big rectangular shaped black or white box with lights and beeps, the compter was a smart idea,! But why do you ask,? i'll show you. This device can teach you a new language, skype can let you talk to @CAPS1 on the web or on phone!, (but you still have to pay @MONEY1.) you can surf the web or have a laugh on youtube, who needs to go out and buy stuff when on ebay or amazon just order and your done, (but you still have to wait.) why go to blockbuster to rent movies when you can go on netflix and order a movie and keep it for as long as you like, no late fees, no driving all the way to the movie store, no more of that please!. Next lets go back to the web, @CAPS2 you own a @CAPS3 or a built in camera on your laptop or netbook, you can video chat with @CAPS1 and family across the globe!, @CAPS2 you'r the kind of person that like video games then boy you will love this!, @CAPS5 ~~@CAPS6's can download games such as sim's, spore, etc. then you will love the @CAPS6. MACs also share good stuff such as the finder, safari, dashboard, etc, so thats all i have to say about @CAPS8. And now you are probably asking which computer should i get?, @CAPS9 @CAPS12 friend's at @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 you have the abillty to choose either @CAPS8 or @CAPS6, but it's not @CAPS12 disision to pick out your computer, it's yours so go out and create an investment for a computer today!. but im not finished yet you can also pick a laptop, a desktop, or a netbook I can tell about all of them and I will, a laptop is good @CAPS2 your on the go a lot and @CAPS2 your in the office or you have a lot of business trips its a good idea th have a laptop at hand,. a desktop is good @CAPS2 your home a lot and work is oniline on the web or just llike the comfort of home than a desktop is right for you!, and last but not least, the netbook, it's good @CAPS2 your on the go a lot especialy when yory on vacation, and it fits nicely on your lap or on a table or @CAPS2 you dont want to get up to use the computer just grab your netbook and your ready to go, I almost forgot all netbooks come with a built in @CAPS3 so @CAPS2 your on vacation and you dont have a phone or computer just go on your netbook and there you go. well thats all I have to say thanks for reading "
