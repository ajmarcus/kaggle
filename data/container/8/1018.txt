"Dear local Newspaper, I think that computers have a good effect on people. My first reason is that some people at college are far away from home like my sister and my family talks to her through the computer. Also many people have an email! that tells them about sales at grocery stores or clothing stors and it saves people money using those cupons. Statistics state that grownups that use the computer at night feel more awake in the @TIME1. My second reason is that if someone is going on vacation or they are moving they can go on the internet and find out if where there going is safe or if they have a nice school there and they can learn about the place and see what it looks like. they can also find out about colleges and see how nice they are see if its a small school if there are alot of kids that go to that school and etc. My third and final reason is that when people use the computer there. hand eye coordination gets better because when your typing your moving your fingers and your geting the feeling when you use it and your geting faster at typing. Also your not just siting there your moving your fingers and your using your brain. Scholastic kids states that kids who use the the computer and use the keyboark brings there @CAPS1 up @NUM1 points. in conclusion I dont think that the computer has a bad effect after your done reading thise I hope you agree with me."
