"Dear newpapers journalist, People shouldn't have computers. Computers have a negative effect on most people. The @LOCATION1 has The highest number of obese citizens in the world. A lot of people spend their day sitting in front of a computer and work. Then they go home and go on their own computers instead of going for a walk or a bike ride. Some people like to look at photos of nature or birds on the internet, even though there's a whole forest outside. Another problem with computers is how safe they are. There are a lot of people on computers that don't belong there, and are trying to hack onto your computer. Viruses can sneak into your computer without you knowing it, and can look up eveything on your computer, even personal information. They can even monitor what your typing, which could be passwords! A lot of people have been paying their taxes online and if there is a virus on their computer, they could get their person's personal information! Plus, most people who pay their taxes online have to use their online bank accounts, so now. They have your bank account password too! Computers are bad for most people. They make people become unhealthy and can get their personal information hacked by a virus."
