"@CITY1 @CAPS1: I believe that computers (for now) are a good thing for our society. They allow you to see places. If you have a long distance relationship you can talk to them and they have many good excessories. What if you were looking for a new home? You could use google to search of selling homes in a certain location. Then finding some one to move your stuff for a fair price. Computers have many websites that you can go to when looking for that special place. The computer is also handy when you are going on vacation. You can look up the weather for that time. If you are going somewhere for, you can use the computer to find a plane. Computers are helpful when it comes to places! The excessories on the computer are endless. One big excessory that people like to do is games. Games are great to get your mind going. Practically all of the grades require hand-eye coordination. For example, @ORGANIZATION1. You need to remove all the tiles before the time runs out! If you are bored, games are very fun. I think that games are a great excessory. Some people have long distance relationships right? Well, if you have a computer you can have an online. This relieves many people when they know your not there. If you have an email, you can talk"" to your friends that you dont see at school. This gives you a chance to connect with them. Myspace and facebook are very similar. These are what you can use to talk to your friends at school. Computers are very useful. As you can see, I have stated many good reasons. Excessories, ""talking"" to people. Also, places. Many people use computers in their every day life. Computers are awsome!"""
