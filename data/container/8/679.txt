"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 I am going to inform you that more and more people are using computers then spending time with their family. I agree with the effects computer haves on people, because one it allows us to access information, two it allows us to interact with people. And three because it helps us updated on what is happening in sports or everything. My first reason why we should use computers is because it gives us information, like the weather reports, school openings, delays, and closings. It also tell's us how @LOCATION1 has been after the earthquake. It tells us alot of stuff. It allow's to go to other websites to find information to. And it allow's us to have fun and play games on the internet. It can help us on our homework. And it can help us find things like job and other stuff. My second reason why we should use computers is because we can ineract with people. We can talk to people weve never ever met before. We can find information about them and tell us how is their life litte. it can help police find info about their criminals and track them down so they can them. It is better and faster than using the phone to talk to them. And it can make people have fun which will make them stay on the computer for a long period of time. My third reason why we should use computers is because it would keep us updated on and for these who love to watch it would tell us the most recent on teams and players. And if you a sports fanatic you can be able to watch live games on the computer. And we can be able to post games and have a chance to see the players talk to their fans. In conclusion this why we should use computers because it can give us information all over the world, two it can allow us to interact with people weve never met before. And three it will keep us updated on sports we like to catch especially if your a sports fanatic."
