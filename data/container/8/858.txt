"Dear @CAPS1, More and more people do use computers, but it is not a bad thing. Student come home from school tired, bored, and doesn't want to go outside and exercise. Students would rather go on the computer. When students go on the computer they can chat thier friends, listen to music, or learn about distant places. Firstly, students would chat their friends on the computer. When it is winter, students can't go outside and exercise. Students can grab their laptop, and go on their warm and comfortable table bed to chat friends. Maybe a friend can help with homework. Going outside in the winter can make students sick and miss days of school. Secondly, students like to listen to music. Music is an important part to a student because music lyrics can express themselves. Students @MONTH1 be dancing to their favorite song. Dancing is exercise and adults do say we need more exercise. Also students can play very soft music than not doing homework at all. Thirdly, students can learn about distant places. When I am on the computer I type in www.google.com and want to learn about a place where I want sto visit other student might want to learn about places they've never visited. Italy, france, @LOCATION1, and much more places people would want to visit. They would want to learn about places before ever go. In conclusion @CAPS1, more and more people go on the computer, but it does not have to be a bad thing. Yes, students should go exercise but all the time. When students go on the computer they can chat with friends. Secondly, students can listen to music. Thirdly, they can learn about distant places. @CAPS1, it is not a bad thing that students go on the computer."
