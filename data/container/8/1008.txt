"Dear: local newspars @CAPS1 recently been brought my attendchon, that people should use computers. My three arugment are they tach hand - eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places and people, and even allow People to talk on line with other people. @CAPS1 tachs people hand-eye coordination because when people type on the kyebord the more and more ther type on the kyebord and the faster and faster. Mach people have more coordinion first, they get used to typeing then, they start typeins fast last when they type fast @CAPS1 give them more hand-eye coordinion. Useins computers give people the ability to learn about far away Places and people because they could such google people and places then @CAPS1 show a lot of wedsite then when they go on one wedsite they type in the person name and state then @CAPS1 show them the places of person. Computers give people the ability to talk with people from other place like aim, myspace or face book and people could play games and talk at the same time so the computer is very poplure this time because of what people mack there wedsite do and this is why I think people should use computer far a lot of like my three @CAPS2 so @CAPS1 been to my attenchon that people should use computer for three reson i is tach hand - Coordination give people the ability to learn abount far away places and people, and even allow people to talk online withe other people so this is why I sajust people should use computer."
