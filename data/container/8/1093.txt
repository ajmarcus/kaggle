"Dear Newspaper, I thought that I should express my concern. @CAPS4 are becoming to dependant on computers. @CAPS4 need to go outside more and be active. While some people @MONTH1 think were not wasting our time on the computer. I @CAPS3. I'll should only go on if it is nessesary. People are always coming up with @CAPS2 gaming ideas to draw people in, but what people dont realize is that is doesent only waste there time in waste our money too. Electricys bills are trough the roughtAlso instead og going out to meet @CAPS1 people are staying home and talking on social networking sites which make them less social. Children are not enrolling in sports which makes them losse any physical strength they would get. Also children could be getting over wait by just sitting there with no pysical activitys, @CAPS2 ideas like microsoft word is fine but going on every day for games is. Teachers, parent, and all need to show these that the computer is not the only thing, Computers can benifit us very well, by letting us have knoledge of somthing at the tip of our fingers. Computers can and will take away family and friend time. Now im not saying that computer but what am saying is that it effects everyone around you, @CAPS3 just the person thats using it. What @CAPS4 need to @CAPS3 is get together and unite. @CAPS4 need to go outside more, and exersise. @CAPS4 need to stop the computer with adults. Therfore, lets make this a better place. and get out and have a little time for going on to the computer."
