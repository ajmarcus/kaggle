"Computers, Computers, Computers, its all we hear about today. New websites, chatrooms, games and much more. I agree with the experts who think that we should spend more time outdoors with friends and family. Computers take over peoples lives, you don't know who is looking you up on facebook or @CAPS4 and know you can do almost anything on them. Lunch...,@CAPS1...,@CAPS2...,@CAPS3....Computers are taking over our lives. Believe it or not some people bring computers everywhere they go and once you get on that @CAPS3 chances are you won't be getting of it for a while because you keep clicking and keep finding new stuff. I do have to say computers are a cool device but there has to be a limit. We can not be on the @CAPS3 @NUM1 looking up what @PERSON1 said to @PERSON2... You got to come back to earth and spend time with your family. The @CAPS3 might be a cool device but that does not meen that it is safe to post stuff about you on. Facebook & @CAPS4, probably two of the most dangerous sites to be on. Anybody could just type in @PERSON1 and get @NUM2 maches and find you eventhough you don't know them. People are not always as they say they are. People could say taht they are a @NUM3 year old. Just leaving college when it's really a @NUM4 year old @CAPS6 just getting ready to enter the senior center. Don't trust anybody. Now and days you don't even have to leave your house. You can shop, talk, @CAPS5 taxes, bills, and have a vurtual life on the @CAPS3. Pretty soon @CAPS6 kind as a human will become all together through the @CAPS3. Some computers probally have a smarter system then same humans do. What I am saying is limit your time to the @CAPS3 or thats where you will be spending it all. Know you know that I think that computers need to be seen less throughout the human day. Also that they are taking over our lives, are dargerous, and you don't even have to leave your house to make a living. I hope you take my thoughts into consideration. Thank you."
