"Dear Local @CAPS1 Newspaper, @CAPS2 I see why some people think that computers and technology are bad for society, I on the other hand strongly disagree with them. In my eyes technology, especially computers can bring people together and computers are very benificial to @CAPS5. Also computers can save you time and money now. First off computers can bring people together. I had one of my best friends move across the country, all the way to @LOCATION1! and I don't get to see her so I now video chat with her on my laptop. and if I didn't have that opportunity then we probably wouldn't have stayed in touch with each other. That experience was not only with a friend but it happened with a family member as well, my grandmother. Every year for passover the whole family comes to house to celebrate but because she is getting older we video chat so she can see the whole family together. It is wonderful experience. As I said before computers can be benifical to @CAPS5. You might be thinking ""@CAPS3 it can only understand that but I am a student at @ORGANIZATION1 and sometimes I forget to write an assignment down so I get my laptop and go to @ORGANIZATION1 notes. com, if that was have gotten a zero on the homework. See! Computers are very benifical! Have you ever been in a situation where you need something but you just don't have time? Well now many things can be ordered offline. You can get things from food to cloths and toys. Surveys have proven that over @PERCENT1 of average @CAPS4 order off of the computer and save money from gas because they don't have to drive. Overall, I think computers can be handy and helpful to all ages, @CAPS5 with homeworks, family and friends and adults who don't have a lot of time. And I think as years go by more and more people will start to realize that."
