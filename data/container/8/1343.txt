"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, People are using computers all the time but computers help us all the time in positive ways. Computers help us look @CAPS3 information, talk to people around the world, and buy stuff from our house. In a technilogical age the possibilities are endless. I have cousin in @LOCATION1 and I talk to him through webcam @CAPS1 are more people then who talk to @CAPS1 relatives elsewhere actually almost @CAPS2 soldier talks to someone back home. Doctors even say that talking to some one backhome give a soldier more will power to survive. Everyone goes to school, so that means everyone has projecets. During projects a kid want know everything so a good way to get information is to goes on the computer and search what your looking @CAPS3. The computer has trillions of websites that people You can anything fromhow man started to the. Be a sport person and @CAPS2 one likes to get @CAPS3 free online, @CAPS1 are websites like @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 so you can. If you like that song go on @CAPS7, @ORGANIZATION2, lymewire, of any other store to and download to your @NUM1 or @CAPS8. In this time I hope you have learned more about the computer and have changed your mind. Even though @CAPS1 are bad people and bad websites doesn't mean the computers bad."
