"Dear Newspaper, People always believe that technology today such as computers are making more and more people lazy and not going out into the real world such as people who don't spend time with family, become very unfit, and also @CAPS1 websites and people you talk to can put you in harms way and you can get hurt. First, who wouldn't want to spend time with family and find out things that happend to them, @CAPS1 people because they are to busy being on the computer instead of going camping with the family, going to an amusement park and also some family gatherings. People who thinks that the computers is a helping thing to use but @PERSON1 said ""@CAPS1 people learn much easier from family of friends then from a computer. Second, @CAPS1 people are becoming @CAPS2 because of computers intead of going for a walk or nice day they sit in their room and sit on the computer and seeing virtual things instead of seeing things. @CAPS1 prove who are sitting on the computer people you might should be joining a sports learns with everyday. Last, @CAPS1 @CAPS3 that go on the computer and adults are getting because of the of talking to people you have never seen or really know about. When you are on and someone and live where you live they can be lieing and you could take them seriously and meet up with them and that is how you can get killed or go missing. Also, the computer allows you to put pictures and videos online and a lot of teens and adults are posting up on the internet very inapropriate pictures of these bodies and people should't be seeing that. I hope that if you or a family is always on the computer you should say you need to spend time with your family, you can become very unfit, and you can be at risk of getting hurt by people you don't know."
