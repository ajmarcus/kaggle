"Dear, editor @CAPS1 you know, @PERCENT1 of children who spend most of their time on the computer that do not exercize can develop weight problems and blood disorders? That is just one way that advances in computer technology have affected people so far. If advances continue that number will increase and other problems @MONTH1 arise from it. Some other problems that we have @DATE1 that could get worse are, developing a weak immune system, and emotionally seperating yourself from your family. First, lets talk about obesity. Obesity is a terrible sight to see someone go through because of something as silly as being, basically, addicted to the computer. Not only can obesity constrict vital organs but it can lead to blood disorders. Blood disorders, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, can cause you to have a heart attack. Which cuts off oxygen to vital areas of the body. Which leads to, eventually, promote death. Dealing with obesity is bad enough, but seeing them suffer because they have developed a weak immune system is horrable. In my experience I find that people who are on the computer often generally don't have very good immune systems. For example, a friend of mine is on the computer quite often, and has developed a weak immune system. Because of it he misses at least @NUM1 day of school a week. And because he misses so many days a school year he usually keep bad grades. Which is yet another reason why advances in computer technology are a bad idea. So isn't it relatively obvious that advances in technology are a bad idea? Especially being that, children are steadily becoming obese, and developing a weak immune system can affect your life in ways that are totally controllable? So I urge you to write an article about this to stop the growing sickness known as health problems due to technology."
