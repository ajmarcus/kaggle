"Dear local Newspaper, This is a letter about how I feel about the effects of computers. I think computers are great you can, interact with family and friends, learn about things going on around the world, and it could help you with school work. First I would like to say that you can interact with family and friends. You can just go on facebook, @CAPS1, or,myspace and talk, send pics, and comment on other peoples things. There are many groups you can join too, wich allows you to talk to other people and meet new friends. You can also interact with your family if they have a facebook or @CAPS1. The second reason why computers are not bad is because that there are many websites that you can find different information like science, math, history and all that kind of stuff. There are alot of different topics you can learn. You can find information from the weather to where your family history comes from. My last reasoning for thinking this way is that many kids do their homework on computers and if people are saying that computers are bad than the parents are not going to allow them to use the computer for educational purposes like homework and projects. There are many other reason why computers have a positive effects of people. But interacting with family and friends, learning about things around the world and your education depends on computers."
