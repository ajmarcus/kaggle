"Dear @PERSON1, Computers are very helpful in daily activities, but computers have a bad side. Some users are addicted to their @CAPS1 or @CAPS2, they are away from friends and family, and they are not exersizing it if fun to use the @CAPS4 but you should not use it too much! Some people are almost addicted to their @CAPS4. I cant blame them they can charge their ipod, tweet, listen to music, palying games and much more all at the same time! computers are great, but using it too much can make you miss out on tons of activities. People almost feel (some do) that they HAVE to go on facebook to harvest their crops in farmtown, or control their @LOCATION1 on @CAPS3. They get so wrapped up in it that they miss out on their important daily activities. It shouldn't  that for but its became an epidemic, eveybody is being sucked into their computers! People who are on their @CAPS4 @NUM1 are away from their friends and family! they are like oh i haven't talked   his surgery i wonder how he is! Lets see! They go on and  You can talk to someone in just a click! Talking to someone  facebook or twitter is no the same as talking to them in person! Its like people think computers is     @CAPS4 take people away from their friends and family and them talk only on facebook  .When people on the @CAPS4 they become lazy! A person who is @CAPS4 addict will say "" @CAPS5 supposed to go to they gym but let me check my twitter first!"" two hours later then they go the gym! People don't exercise as often as the should! When people are going to lay on the @CAPS4 for @NUM2 minutes it takes @NUM3 hours! They have to sign in, chat with their friends, check their mail look at their tweets look at their restaurnat  check out videos on youtuve and do all other kinds of things! Computers are good but have sideeffects getting addicted, being away from friends and family, and not exercising. @CAPS4 addicts should minimize their time on the @CAPS4!"
