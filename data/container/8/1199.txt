"Dear Newspaper I think that computers have a positive effect on people, here are my reasons. You can get in contact with people, if you have a question you can look it up and you can do your job on a computer. I think that these reason will have you positive too. Many people like computers and have one. My first reason is you can get in toch with friends and family. I think this is a good reason because if your grandmother lives in @LOCATION2 you dont want to drive there every time you want to see her when you live in @LOCATION1. You would use the computer to live chat with her so you wouldent have to drive all the doun there. If you wanted to you could plan a day to go and see her. You would use a computer to get in touch with friends. If you needed to ask them a question about the homework they could answer it. That is my first reason why computers have a positive way on people. My second reason is if you have a computer you can look up questions that you would have. If you needed to know some thing for a big report and none of your friends are up you can look up your computer. Computers can help you so much if you need an answer. If you didet hav a computer if you would be so hard to do stuff. That is why I think that computer can answer your questions. My third reason is you can work on the computer. If your a stay at home mom ya can work on the computer to handle finances. A lot of people work on the computer to save the envirment. When I grow up Ill probaly work on the computer because it is easer. That is why I think that you can work on the computer. The reason I picked were you can get in tuch with family and friends, you can look up a question that you might have, and you can work on a computer. I hope you have a positive way on computers they help you out. People might think that they not your brain not they dont help and knoledge you. Many people like and have one. I think that you should have a positive way on computers too."
