"Dear @CAPS1 -in-@CAPS2, Computers are very helpfull tools in todays society and culture. They build cognitive skills and offer a vast wealth of knowledge. I want you to understand all the benefits a computer provides. First off, computers enchance our hand-eye coordination skills. When typing, we look at the screen, while using our hands to type this becomes almost second-nature after a period of time, proof that it is helping with this cognitive skill. Having good hand-eye coordination is a critical part of driving, and many other tracks we perform throughout the day. Also, you must consider the near infinite amount of knowledge available on this tool. You can learn just about anything on the internet, and most of it is absolutely free. In fact, on websites like @CAPS3 alone, you can find a webpage, dedicated to just about anything. Contrary to the counter-arguments belief, a computer can actually aid in our social life. With instatn messengers like @CAPS4 and @ORGANIZATION1 you can converse with people around the world in real time. Social networks like @CAPS5 allow your to keep your friends posted on what you are doing. Please take my letter into account, and publish it in your editorial. I believe computers help us with cognitive skills, learning, and socializing. Thank for your time."
