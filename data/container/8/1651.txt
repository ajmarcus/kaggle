"Dear local newspaper, I think computers have a positive effect on people. Some adults and mostly kids are not getting enough exercise, or even spending time with family. Some parents are less active with their kids. Kids are failing to do their homework because they are always on the computer when they get home. Adults and kids are getting less excersize. Sitting down reading or what ever they do on the computer is not excersizeing. They are going to get fat because they eat and sit down and than they get hungery again than eat and sit down. Some people say that your getting finger and arm exsersize by and moveing the mouse, thats not really true. Looking at the computer screen all day can cause masive hand People are also not spending time with family. They are sitting infront or a computer and ignoring everyone and everything around them. Kids could be enjoying other things besides computers. Parents could be outside. Playing catch with their kids or even playing a board game with them. People are not less active. They are not going out and haveing fun jumping around with their friends. Instead they aim them on computers or message them on facebook or even myspace. Kids are failing in school because they fail to do their home work after school. They would rather go on the computer. This is why i think computers have an positive effect on kids and adults."
