"Dear @CAPS1 post, Computers have been here for a while now and taking them away would be like forgetting all the progress we made in technology. Computers are everywhere in fact, seven out of ten families on my street own atleast one computer in their household. So why would we want to take them away? Computers are too useful. Computers are not only fun, but very resourceful. Anybody with a question faild easily hop on a computer, research it on google.com and find what they were looking for within minutes. I remember when I had a cut on my arm that looked weird, my mom was to heal a wound. She researched it and got how to the mark go away. The computer only benefits you in a way. Is most likely them youll be staying at in two weeks and realize they don't have a pool! Lastey, without computers we would have no communication with new or different people. Computers are great for communicating. People are able to comunicate through twitter, @CAPS2, and even youtube. The sites all help people make new friends online almost like pen pals on the internet. Also, if the majority of your family lived in @LOCATION1 and you were stuck in @CAPS3, you could easily talk to them through email or an instant messanger. Hopefully now you have a better understanding of how much of a lifesaver the computer is. Maybe you could even make next @STATE1 about how resourceful, beneficial and social computers are!"
