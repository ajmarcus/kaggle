"More and more people use computers but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Well, to me it does benefit society in many ways like, learning online. You can learn many things online, you can practice math, reading, and even writing. You can also have fun online if your bored at home and have nothing to do. Also, you can interact with friends and family members, by email etc. When your online you can learn alot of things. If your at home, and you need to study for a test, you can go online and study. You can also learn more, because you can learn how to do a math problem if you don't know it, or just catch up on reading. People sometimes need a computer because they might be bored, so they can go online and play games and have fun. People, especially kids get bored at times, so they can just go on the computer and play games and trivias so they can still learn. Computers can let you interact with your family and f riends. You can e-mail or webcam. if yopu haven't talk to someone a long period of time you can just go to the computer and talk to them. If you want to find a @CAPS1 school classmate that you haven't talked to in years, you can now. Computers do benefit the society, In my own opinion we do need computers. If parents do not want their child on websites they don't approve of, the parents can always block those websites. Computer are really nessacary they can help in a huge way."
