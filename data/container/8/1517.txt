"I believe computers have a positive effect on people because computers can help people in many ways. You can e-mail friends from across the world, get important information you might need, and also you can do business online. Computers have fasinating things to show and inform. Most people that have computers can use them for e-mailing friends. Sometimes your closest friends are across the country & you want to talk to them. Why not e-mailing them on your computer? It would mean a lot to your friends it you just take time to say hello through e-mail. My second opinion on why using computers are a positive effect on people because. Some middle school through college & the rest of you life need to use computers. Maybe because of some important information they might need for an assignment from a teacher. Not all the time you can find certain things in books. Now a days computers are taking over books. My third opinion for computers is that some people are to ill to go to work so they work online. Even though you are ill you will still be getting paid because you are still working. So women just had a baby & she is using her computer to work online. So she can make money so she can support her femily. In conclusion, my opinion is that computers have a positive effect on people because they are used for e-mailing friends, finding out important information for school purposes or job purposes. My last opinion is that computers are used for working online. To me, I think computers are a positive effect on people."
