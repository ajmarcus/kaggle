"Dear newspaper company, More and more people use computers each day. But not every one agrees it benefits society. Some people say the people that are on computers dont get exercise or play outside. Then when they get off the computer their eyes hurt and they cant see as well. But will all that said I agree with the benefits of computers is very well used. The reasons why I agree with computers have benefits is that. It gives you hand-eye coordination give people info on faraway places. They can also rent hotels movies and games. You can even talk to people online from around the world! What if we didn't have computers though then what if a serious crime happend then we wouldn't be able to find the criminals name or his records! Some bad reasons for having computers is a big issue right cyberbullying! Kids might get picked. On and he will. People get called names all the time. Another big problem is online they seem freindly then they try to. There is two big problem with computers its called plagarism. Plagarism is when you take some ones work and put your name on the. It can be also be when you steal and say its yours. The second problem is stealing music getting it for free. By downloading from the internet like lime wire. Then the the song dont get the money from the albums. That is why I agree with computers give you benefits. They give you bad ones to careful when your on a computer."
