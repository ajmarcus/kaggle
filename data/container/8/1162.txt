"Dear @PERSON1 @CAPS1 I am writing this letter to inform you that I think computers are a smart investment for a couple of reasons. The following are some reasons on why computers benifit society, they allow children to do homework with some help, children can talk to other friend and when children are board they can play games music on it. UGH! I don't get this sometimes I am sitting at the kitchen table tring to do my history homework but I don't know the year the revalotionary war was. @CAPS2 I go in my room turn the computer on and @CAPS6 there I go to google and look up what I need to know. This also benefits parents too because if they are doing the bills or something they don't have to be bothere, the kid could look it up and know it is @CAPS6! Finally all my homework is done but my computer is still on I'm going to see who is online that I can talk to and make sure I didn't miss any homework. Talking to your friends online could help you stay in contact with friends in other states or just people you don't see very often. This can help make new friends or make friendships closer and cause less problems. Alright no body is home or online @CAPS2 I think @CAPS3 going to kick back turn some music to kick back turn some music on and maybe take a nap. Or I can play the new counter strke game I got ! YEAH on playing counter strike. Least death on my team that game! Alright thats enough of counter strike for the day I think I'm going to turn same music on and lay in bed. Now that I have told you all of the benefits of computers You @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6! keep in mind that it can help with homework, talking with friends, or just having some fun."
