"Dear: @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I think computer are one of the most @CAPS3 inventions ever. They help education make everything @CAPS4 and traveling is @CAPS4. It helps education because @CAPS5 always use computers to help kids learn important information. for example if we have to study for something there are websites specialy made for studing. Also there are sites to teach little kids how to read or write. Allmost all @CAPS5 have computers these days. Some @CAPS5 even give computers to kids so they can use it to study. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS5 in the @CAPS7.S use computers more than textbooks and get high test scores. Thats why computers help education. A second reason is it generally makes everything @CAPS4. For example instead of writing an essay for school and having it take hours than your hand is and to findout its filled with miss-spelled words. Instead you can type it quick and use spell check. I have never heard one person say that the computer hasn't make life @CAPS4. Another example is if you had to find some information on you new dog. Instead of goind to your library spending minutes.You can simply open up you internet and then search it and find the info you need in seconds. That's why the computer make every thing @CAPS4. The last reason is that one. Traveling is such a without a computer With out it you have to go to to buy tickets. In fact I don't even remember what it was like to not @CAPS9 online with a computer all you have to do is go to the parts websites and then but it from there its so easy areselfs to places but traveling mail to each other also. I haven't sent a @CAPS8 card in years. Instead I @CAPS9 email. It quicker, @CAPS4 and more reliable. That is why traviling people and mail is @CAPS4. Over all the computer is one of the most helpful things ever and with technology upgraing daily soon it will be even @CAPS4 to do things. While too much computer is bad and people souldn't @CAPS9 interact with internet. The computer games in handy almost all the time. That is why i think the computer is @CAPS3."
