"Some of the @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are that they were docked by means of an electric winch, wihich houlad in a line from the front of the ship and then tied into the mast. Also the dirigibles body could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and get off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open oservation platform.
