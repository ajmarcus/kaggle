"How the features of the setting affected the cyclist in the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Limit”, were very dangerous to his life. The cyclist was traveling to the Yosemite National Park on a hot @DATE1. The cyclist traveled miles after miles on his bike only to past by deserted towns, “This place might have been thriving little spot...a ghost town.” The terrain was threatening because after twenty two miles or so, the cyclist had to overcome, “short rolling hills”, which would use more energy and make his thirst for water even stronger. The cyclist was out of water and the hot day was not helping. After a grueling journey, the cyclist used all the strength he had to go to a local bait shop and drank from the sink after the trechorous environment he was exposed to. The features of the setting in the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” were life threatening and almost killed the cyclist, due to lack of water and the terrain he overcome."
