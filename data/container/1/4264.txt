"In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed Limit,” is about a man that follows some bad directions and in the middle of a desert is stuck without water. He starts to lack confidence in the directions when the setting changes. He said, “After fourty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first town it fit the traditional definition of ghost town.” He had been told this was a thriving town but was left with nothing. This was a big let down and the cyclist wasn’t so positive this had been the right choice. He keeps on riding and finds another dissetling sight.” One ramshacle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that wouldn’t  hold in the lamest of mule greeted me.“ @CAPS1 was another place said to be good but all he got was battery flavored water. On the last strech of his bike met with rough rolling hills, a diamondback looking snake, and an abandoned juice factory. All of this brang his spirits lower and lower until he thought he would die. The cyclist ended up finding a store but he was discauraged by the environment he was in a hot and could have died."
