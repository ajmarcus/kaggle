"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to leave readers guessing and wondering what will be next. You can tell by the tone of the last paragraph, When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The author seems to leave at tone of suspense."
