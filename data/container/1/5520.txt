"I belive that the author included this paragraph to show that you she didn't give up, to show that she kept trying after she failed. Saeng said to her mother ""I failed the test"". Also to make her sound proud and happy to try the test over again. Also I have failed test. I also said that I would take them over but I didn't. So the author put that in their to show how determin she was going to sound."
