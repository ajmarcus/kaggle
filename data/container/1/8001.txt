"The @CAPS1 created by the author in the memoir is Very necessary. I say this because I don't like any writing that doesn't have @CAPS1 swings. this author does a good job of showing the emotions of Narciso Rodriguez in their story. A place in the story where I really like the @CAPS1 swing is between @CAPS2 @NUM1 and @NUM2. I like this change because, it goes from talking about a landlord and his daughter to talking about @ORGANIZATION2's parents. I like that because, it creates a mode of @NUM3 different backgrounds on the two different @CAPS3 of People. It talks about how @PERSON1's Parents were imigrants and weren't raised well buts they wanted their son to have a better childhood life than them. On the other hand, the landlord and his daughter @LOCATION1 , were rich and Could do anything they wanted. I am just blown away by how this author changes his moods."
