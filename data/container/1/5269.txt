"Different features of the settings affect the cyclist. The setting of the story, which is based in the desert has a negative affect on the character. ÒThe desert land is baron, leaving him only with his small supply of water. During his journey he runs out of water causing him to lose contact with reality. The extreme heat in the desert causes him to begin to hallucinate. The cyclist begins to see a grape juice factory, which interrupts his trip. To his dismay, it turns out to be a no more than a mirage. The lengthy road also affected the trip. The length and roughness of the road had worn the cyclist down."
