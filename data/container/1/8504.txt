the mood created by the author in the memoir would be sad because he is remembering a really good time in his life and he knows it wont happen again but at the same time he is happy for having a good childhood and misses the good times and he is feeling greatful for his parents hard work when things looked bad thats how I think the authors mood would be in this memoir.
