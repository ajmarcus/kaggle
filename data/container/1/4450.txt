"Many features of the cyclists surroundings effect his speed and confidence. He was the only one on the road. There were no other cars, bikes, motor cycles, or even buildings. Its like hes on the countryside. So that makes him want to go faster, because he wont hit any thing. The fact that hes alone in the wide, open spaces boosts up his energy level and makes him feel more confident."
