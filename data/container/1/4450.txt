"Many features of the cyclist’s surroundings effect his speed and confidence. He was the only one on the road. There were no other cars, bikes, motor cycles, or even buildings. It’s like he’s on the countryside. So that makes him want to go faster, because he won’t hit any thing. The fact that he’s alone in the wide, open spaces boosts up his energy level and makes him feel more confident."
