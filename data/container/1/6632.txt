"The author concludes the story this way with a quote that says she will get another try at something. Many authors end stories at a diff way because it makes the reader wants to go on to a sequal or the next story, and I really adds a twist to the ending. Also another reason a author would end like that is because they want you to work your imagination so you picture what happens next. Using this is effective because you know what has happened and It make the reader wonder if she  fails or succeeds the next time around."
