"The mood story the author creates is a prideful memoir of his life/home and what others did for him, while living in a time of hate/racism. He feels foreverly grateful for the love and sacrifice his parents showed to him. He was happy that during these times people of of different culture/ethnicity were treating all in the community like family. The mood and emotion of this memoir is of pride/love for others and caring."
