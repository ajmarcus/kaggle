"I think that she ended the story like that because it means that she is getting used to all the seasons. In the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hisbiiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. She will and take the test once its not cold anymore so she will wait until the geese come again which will be spring by then. I think that she is also trying to say that when the snow melts and the geese are there again she will have taken the test and pass it. This is I think she ended it like this because how they mean something to her."
