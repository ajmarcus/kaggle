"In the reading comprehension ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock because they wanted to add the mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building's flat roof and the dirigibles would be able to take the mooring mast up to the top of the building. The architects found out that if they put the mooring mast on the top of the building its gonna bring stress to the building's foundation."
