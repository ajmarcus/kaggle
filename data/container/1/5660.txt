"The author concludes the story with, when they come back, saeng vowed Silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, to show that even though she failed her test she isnt giving up and that she will persevere over this and continue to try. This ending shows the determination in Saengs heart. Saeng has enough determination inside of her to go on even though she failed her test and failed her grandmother to continue trying and continue to try to complete for her grandmother and herself. I really liked this ending and I am glad that the author decided to use this ending in the story."
