"In the memoir ""@PERSON1 from Home: The blueprints of our lives."" I belive the author Narciso Rodriguez, demostraigted the mood of being laidback very acticulatly.This memoir dose not soud very formal due to the fact Narciso does little things like adding parenthenthese with aditoal statments for exsample in paragraph @NUM1. And taking about his friends and family so openly.Thats why I @PERSON1's memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The blue prints of our lives."" @CAPS1 the mood of being laid back."
