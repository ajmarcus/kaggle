Two of the biggest setting in this story is the desert and rolling hills. This would effect the rider becaus of the dehydration that he would experience. Being in the desert would make it obviously hot so you sweat alot and the hills would make it tough on your body because you put extrat strain to get up them. So all together this would be a hard bike ride.
