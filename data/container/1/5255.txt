"The setting of this story is outside. Yosemite is outside riding her bike. She is around hills, no water, and very hot land. You know that she is around hills because she says to herself, “… I maneuvered down the hill.” You also know that she starts of around no??? ???good water. “When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid…” that shows the water was bad. Also the land is very hot because it says “…in the??? ???of two hundred degrees.” Yosemite starts off bad then ends up learning to stick to it and never give up. Yosemite’s biggest problem is her lack of water due to the fact that it is hot outside and the water she had was bad, tasting like battery acid. "
