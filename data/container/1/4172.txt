In the story Rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie the features had a more negative affect on the cyclist. The cyclist got tired because of the big hills and he liked the scene which was they only good that if had on hon. The water bottle only contained a few tantallizg sips. he didnt have enough water and he was thirsty. At some point a rediculously large  snak it really did look like dimond backbloked the majority of the pavement. It is dangerous where he was riding and even though he was on a bike he could have been bit. All of these points I made showed the negative affect.
