Happy. You should always be proud where you came from. Not only that back your background like your culture and your parents. Stuff like that. Never be ashamed about stuff like that even if your diffrent it shouldn't matter. The more diffrent you're the more unique you're.  Just look at it that way. Plus you should never change just because of what you're and what you look like.
