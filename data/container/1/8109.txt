"In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, she uses key terms and phrases to discuss the mood in paragraph @NUM1 she says, ""Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This line puts a clear picture in your head of what it would be like to have lived in that home. Another time Narciso Rodriguez puts a clear picture of the setting in your head is in paragraph @NUM2. She is stating where her parents must live and says, ""braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics."" This line puts the setting in my mind which makes it more clear to picture the home and setting. Narciso does a great job describing the mood of each location."
