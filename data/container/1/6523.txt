"The author of ,ÓWinter Hibiscus ,Ó concludes the story with the paragraph,Ó When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring , when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again .ÓThe author most likely chose this as the last paragraph to help the reader  understand  the message. The message of this story is no matter what happens or what challenges you face, never give up and always keep trying. The author makes that the last paragraph to make the reader think and ponder upon what it means."
