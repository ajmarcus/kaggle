"The setting affects the cyclist because it can provide landmarks and directions. For example, the narrator states, “They’d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I would come to along this breezy jaunt” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This shows that the landmarks can provide as landmarks and directions along a journey."
