"In the short story “Winter Hibiscus” Saeng decides to retake failed driver’s test in the spring. She does so because she is comforted on the moderate weather of the spring. It reminds her of home, and Saeng is very closely attached to home. It reminds me of all the places I’ve been and how I still remember my favorite one. Like Saeng, I buy objects that remind me of my old home Saeng’s commitment to her old home makes me feel less different when I miss my old home."
