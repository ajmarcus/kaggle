"The feature of the setting affect the biker a lot because the rough terrain is described which implies that the biker probably had a hard time half way through the story he said, Flat road was replaced by shor, rolling hills. He said this to describe the difficulty in this race. It also makes it seem exciting because it changes things around. It wouldnt be exciting if they said that flat roads turned into even flatter roads, or if they didnt show the terrain change at all."
