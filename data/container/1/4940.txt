"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. First of all he is in the middle of no where, and he doesnt know the direction of where he is going, and he also doesnt know the people who live there. The other thing is that he doesnt have a food, or a drink, so without eating or drinking he cant get energy, so he cant ride the bike."
