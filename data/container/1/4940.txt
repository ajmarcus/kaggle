"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. First of all he is in the middle of no where, and he doesn’t know the direction of where he is going, and he also doesn’t know the people who live there. The other thing is that he doesn’t have a food, or a drink, so without eating or drinking he can’t get energy, so he can’t ride the bike."
