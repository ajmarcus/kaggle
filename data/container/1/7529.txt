"The @CAPS2 is trying to describe his house when he was a kid. In this case he describes his Cuban heritage and how being @CAPS1 is really fun and amazing. The @CAPS2 is saying that the Cuban kitchen is pouring out with amazing foods and during holidays his ""Family"" would come and visit. Cuban is a very exciting culture is what pops into my head after reading this story. The mood is that festivitys and holidays are the best for him."
