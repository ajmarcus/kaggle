The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is that at first was getting to short in who the character was. Like it went slow then fast than slow that person couldn't controle her writeing in the story out all so mood was like think fast  then think hard and good nex time the writer should stay at one speed why then readers give up on the story. Who know's that story could of been the best but Just didnt want to stay at one speed. See me @CAPS2 not the one to talk because I cant write has good but i do read and very welling so take it from a reader not a writer. Also the story was to plan like any other story bad before it gets good I think if the writer he a she would of went slower with describeing the story and would of been different but the frist @NUM1 minoter I was like oh this is like any other story @CAPS2 gona stop reading right now boreing and rush the answer be careful how you write or choice these stories you dont know whats best fo me I do. You dont know me from a hole in a wall get a batter program.
