"It is my hot so the cyclist is very dehydrated, tired and lack of water. I checked my water supply and heated on is a good example oF this. There is also a lot of sad and deserted places with no cars around this bars the cyclists hope of finding civilization. Also not seeing any building and when he sees are it being deserted makes this very hard on the rider. Another event that takes a toll on him is when he @CAPS1 the pump that has tar, dirt, then hot water in it. Also the road plays a toll on him. I know this house he says If I could just make it to that next horizon/hill Ill be alright"".This is how I know the setting and features in the setting is affecting the cyclists mentally and physically."
