The features of the cyclist affect him in many ways. One way that the features affected him was that when he ran out of water all the buildings were like a ghost town. He said that there was no one in sight. In the story it says the bulding abandoned years earlier. If I was him I would of turned around and went back so I would take the chance of not dieing out in the middle of an abandoned area.
