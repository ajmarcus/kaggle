"The setting of the story has a huge affect because it was such a empty terran that made him rely on only himself because of the lack of others to help. For example, if he was riding through a city for hours he could stop and take a break in a store or get water from about any where. But being in the desert it really tested his inner strenght to go on and get to safty."
