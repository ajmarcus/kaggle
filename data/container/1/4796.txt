"Steep mountains, rolling roads, jagged rocks  are all reasons why the setting is affected towards the cyclist. Well the cyclist needs to know what is going on and what @MONTH1 happen. For example Rough Rough: Do not exceed posted speed limit. This setting lead to a lot of changes. So yes the setting does reveals a lot and I guess it describes how the cyclist @MONTH1 react to it also. So yes I think the settings do affect the cyclist through this whole story."
