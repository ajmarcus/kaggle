"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon LŸsted there are many obstacles that the builders stumble across. Many people would have a hard time with creating the docs for the dirigibles for the Empire State Building. One major obstacle that the builders had was ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" Another obstacle that they could come across is that the dirigibles could take to long to fuel up and could cause a jam with other dirigibles. Even though they had this huge obstacle they managed to get their way and they found a way to actually use the dirigibles without any types of problems."
