Saeng feels more comfirtable in the spring because it reminds her of home. She probably never experienced snow or winter before. So nothing in this time of year reminds her of home. In the spring it does because the geese return and the hibiscus grow again making everything feel like its her home again. Conferdence is what she receives when spring comes again.
