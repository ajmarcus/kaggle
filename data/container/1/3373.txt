"The builders of the Empire State built two floors just for the passengers to drop off their luggage. They had a view in those floors, and was the idea didn't work, they wasted money on those extra rooms.They started working on the build and attempt to make dirigibles dock on the top, but they wasted alot of time and money, and it was just a waste altogether."
