"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by dehydrating him. The cyclist said, I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake."" The cyclist was in the desert and each mile he rode he became more and more dehydrated.  The desert sun drying out his body. He said with each passing landmark, I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.  @CAPS1 that the more he went on the more the desert affected him and dehydrated him."
