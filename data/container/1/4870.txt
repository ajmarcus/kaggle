"In the passage Do not exceed posted speed limit, there are many features from the setting that affected the cyclist. One feature that affected the cyclist was the snake he encountered on his way, for example in the text it says At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake, I cased post, tyring to keep my balance in my dehydrated state This proves that the snake was a feature that affected the cyclist by giving him a point to stay calm even in the state he was in being dehydrated and all the affects he encountered from that."
