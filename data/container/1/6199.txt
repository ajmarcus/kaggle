"Saeng promises herself that  “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test agan.” The hibiscus is meta phorica to Saeng for her childhood. Evidently she grew up in Vietnam and moved to the @LOCATION2. She misses her homeland, and all the flowers remind her of her homeland. She is overwhelmed by all the memories that she breaks down and cries. Change is a difficult thing to overcome or adjust to, especially moving to a foreign country. She has to cope with it though, and by planting the winter hibiscus is a way of coping. She knows that she will eventually adjust to the major change for she realized, “that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become… almost familiar to her now.” She promises herself that she will retake the drivers test when the hibiscus blossoms because like Saeng a flower changes also. When the hibiscus  finally overcome the cold , dreary winter months and blooms, Saeng will know she is ready to take the test again for that flower can also symbolize her going through changes. The geese in the story also symbolize changes, they have to migrate south in the winter to avoid the cold but return home when its warm enough. Like Saeng, she will avoid the test in the winter but in the spring when she feels comfortable."
