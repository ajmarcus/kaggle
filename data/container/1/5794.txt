I think the author is just trying to show that you never give up. I think the author is trying to show the beautie of nature. The author used that because in the story Saeng failed the test but at the end it says that she will take the test again. In the story it talks about the winter hibiscus that she planted and that is concluded in the conclusion. The conclusion basiclly saying is there will be a new beginning.
