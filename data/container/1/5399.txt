"The author concludes the story with this pharagraph because he figures after all that has happened like she failed the test he wanted to end to be remembered is a happy thing. Also wanted the end to show how something bad happened but  next she was going to do it again. The author wanted to show that she wouldnt give up, she goes after what she wants. And he wanted that to be the last pharagraph."
