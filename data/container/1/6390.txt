"The author concludes with this because she is determined to pass the driving test that she had previously failed. For example, She writes she vowed silently to herself. When you vow to do something it usually means that you are very determined to do something. Everything else that she says after that she really means it. Therefore, that is why the author concludes with this sentence, in order to show her devotion to her goal."
