"The author ended that story like that because thats  how she started the story.The little girl was looking at the flowers and plants in the the beginning ,so the author thought that it would be a good thing to end the story like it was started.Also because the friendship that Saeng has with the plants and flowers will come back again in the spring when everything is blooming and looking very beautiful.It shows that the plants give a sense of comfort when she is going through hard times.That is why the author concludes with Saeng and the plants."
