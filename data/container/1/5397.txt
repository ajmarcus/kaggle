"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it has everything together. One way it ties everything together is by taking what had happen in the beginning and tieing it in with why she had bought the flower in the first place. Also it ties Saeng's old memories from Vietnam to her new way of life in the United States. The story states ""carefully Saeng dicked it up and smilled. She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. the familiar programe filled her lungs."" this is now the flower she found in the flower shop gave her memories from Vietnam. this is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph."
