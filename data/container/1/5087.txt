"The setting affected the cyclist by depriving him of hydration and weakening him. The large hills and rough roads ebbed away every bit of his strength and wore him down. The narration states, Over one long, crippling hill (kurmaskie @NUM1). This work choice reflects the writers feeling about his adventure. Words like long and crippling show that the trip was a horrible experience."
