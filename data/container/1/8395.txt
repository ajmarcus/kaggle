"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez the mood is happy. Narciso is happy with his family and his cultre. He is glad that he is with his family. Narciso Rodriguez loves his talent, but he is just a little sad that he won't be able to meet his real grandparents. That is the only thing that he is sad about. Other than that he is as happy as can be."
