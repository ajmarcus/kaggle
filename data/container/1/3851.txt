"The cyclist is dehydrated. He has lack of water for a significant distance before he realizes that the old men would have been right,had he been riding, before the last word war. But any town he rode into, was just a run down, deserted, and abandoned piece of desert. He says,It was a sad, hopeless, laugh, mind you, but at leas I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. @CAPS1 that he was getting more and more dehydrated, but was not quite ready to die. He still had enough energy to keep going, But hope was fading. Then all at once after climbing a large hill he gains all hope back. He sees Gary and Wilbers fish camp The rider is safe now, he stumbles into the modern looking bathroom and drinks from the sink. He is now safe, ready to ride, and avoid all men who havent moved from their front porches in years."
