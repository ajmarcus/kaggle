"I the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, the mood created by the author is about a cuban that came to american without knowing the language and having no money they made it. It wasn't easy though and for that, that is why Narciso is so grateful. She also tells about how alot of people have came and gone because her parents have open arms to anyone."
