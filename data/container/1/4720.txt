The features in the setting affected the cyclist when he got tired very easily because he was biking in the desert in June. There are no rivers in the that desert so he couldnt get water. It is so hot out there that he couldnt see very well because of all the sweat that went into his eyes. Also there are no people out there because of how hot it is.
