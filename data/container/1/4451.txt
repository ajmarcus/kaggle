"To be able to have a good bike ride, you must have a good setting. To me, a good setting would about @NUM1° outside and sunny. You can’t go bike riding in snow because there is no way that the tires will move in the snow. You can’t go in rain or hail because the roads get slippery and you could getin a accident that could injure or kill you. If it is sunny outside you be able to ride freely on dry roads with a little breeze to go through your hair and you could be refreshed. That is why I believe it is important for the setting to be just right for a bike ride."
