"the @CAPS1 the author created was a warming @CAPS1. He gave events from the past which created a content tone. He also used discriptive language about the food, Music, and family. in this memoir it stated that he appricieated his parents very much for their selflessness. in @NUM1 it sais ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood @CAPS2"". This is showing now nis family treated him real well. All in All he gave a good tone in this story."
