"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it makes it hard for him to get to “@CAPS1 National Park”. He took advice from some old men to take a shortcut to get him where he wanted to be. On his ride there, he stopped at a “town”, which was, to him, considered a ghost town. Then he got to a Welch’s Grape Juice Factory, but it was abandoned years earlier and he was becoming weak and dehydrated. He thought he would drop from a heatstroke. At the end of his ride, he reached a fish camp where he found water to drink. A man asked him where he was going and the cyclist told him. Then the man asked him, “Know the best way to get there?” The man was much older than the other old men that gave the cyclist advice. So the cyclist told the man “yes, sir: I own a very good map”. The man realized throughout the setting on his journey, that he would never accept advice from old-timers again."
