"The features setting in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” are very important to the cyclist. In this story, the setting really affected the cyclist because it was in California which is a really hot place during the summer. The cyclist had problems because of the weather and on the shortness of water. Since there was a shortness of water he had to conserve it which slowed him down because he couldn’t ride as much. Although there was a cool wind and a river from Yosemite he had to pass quickly down the hill so he had even more problems. This is why the settings of the story really affected the cyclist and how much he could ride."
