"There are many ways the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One feature is the weather. When a cyclist is on a trip the weather could affect the setting greatly. An example, if it started to rain the roads could become very slippery and dangerous to ride your bike on. The cyclist and his bike could crash and die. Just cause of the weather. Another feature is the animals. An animal is important cause any were you do the are different animals that do different things. If the cyclist knows  the animals around the area that he is traveling he could keep safe and not be harmed. Tis better to know the area and feel safe. Then not knowing whats going to happen next."
