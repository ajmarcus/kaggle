"In the essay ÒRough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.Ó By Joe Kurmaskie. The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he was on a bike and it was hot he ran into bumpy roads, and hills. For example he says ÒNot June miles into the next section of the road. He noticed the terrains changing. Flat land was replaced by short, rolling hills.Ó @CAPS1 example is ÒWide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that he could die from heatstroke.Ó These examples show that it was not easy and how the features affected the cyclist. In conclusion this story shows that you should never take directions from a old person, exspecially if its hot and you are riding a bike."
