"The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. If the cyclist was riding his bike in @LOCATION1 in he middle of June he wouldnt of gotten so dehydrated. This biker is riding in the high deserts of California that reach to @NUM1 degrees. In the middle of @DATE2 in @CAPS1.A it bearly reaches @NUM2 degrees. Also the desert is know to have nothing. If he was riding somewhere else every mile there could be a gas station. Although this cyclist is riding in No @CAPS2s @CAPS3. Lastly the roads in the desert are a lot more dangerous, since people never really drive through, no one really comblains regularly about pot holes and stuff. They are more worried about the cities were many people travel, there is no point to change or fill pot holes where no one really travels."
