@CAPS1 were thought of as the future of transportation Also known as blimps @CAPS1 were like ballons except they were steel and had rubbers and propellers to keep control. These steel balloons can ride eighty miles per hour. The main reason why the empire state building couldn't dock these was because most @CAPS1 from outside the united states use hydrogen instead of hellium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and causes accidents.
