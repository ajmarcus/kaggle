"The mood created by the author in the memoir is sad, and happy because he talks about things that happened to his parents and happy things of his parents. I think the author is sad because they died but he could be happy too. I think I would be sad and happy if my parents died. Thats why I think the mood created by the author in the memoir is sad, and happy. My Parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the united states in 1956. In 1961, I was born into this simple house. I think he was happy where he was born."
