"The mood the author created in memoir was that of happiness and acception. Even though Narciso Rodriguez is Cuban, as well as his family, he fit into his neighborhood, and most likely made a lot of friends very quickly. This gave a feeling of acception as well as a lot of happiness. That is the mood that the auther set on the story."
