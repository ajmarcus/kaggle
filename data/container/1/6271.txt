"The story “Winter Hibiscus” is about a young girl who cares for gardening over schoolwork. The given conclusion is explaining, when spring comes, and the winter hibiscus is gone, she will pass the school test she failed before. Saeng only cares for the winter Hibiscus right now, for example, the line “I paid over nineteen dollars for it.” Explains she used all her money on this plant rather than any other food. Also the quote “I failed the test” with Saeng crying shows she failed it only because she was worrying about the hibiscus. In conclusion over the spring, when the winter hibiscus is gone, Saeng will focus on school more rather than gardening. Maybe now she will pass her test and go back to her hobby of gardening."
