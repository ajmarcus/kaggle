"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he is trying to explain to us that this plant is going to bring good luck. The snow will melt, the geese will return and the hibiscus plant will start budding. Its starting over fresh, a new beggining. Since she had failed her driving test she will start over in the spring. In conclusion this is why I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph."
