"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many was. The cyclist had been riding on the high deserts of California in June. The cyclist also saw a ridiculously large snake. There was also no signs of civilization for miles. There was no one insight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. The cyclist went through many different obsticales travilng, triying to get to Yosemite. I think the settingS affected the cyclist in many ways."
