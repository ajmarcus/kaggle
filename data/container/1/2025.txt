"The obstacles the builders had to face where rational, but there are some things you sould think of first, such as peoples safty, aircraft hight limets, and wind. They they thought about how to dock it, How to get the passengers safly to the landing area. What they did work on was smart though, they had the the thing that connects the dirigibles to the dock, the electric winch. They had a baggage, and ticket area. What they thought of was smart, but the other stuff first."
