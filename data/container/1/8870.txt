In this memoir the mood created by the author is very positive. The author is turning @CAPS1 not good into a much better thing. Like when they had a very small house they turned it into a home. The people living in this small house let people stay with them until they got back on there feet. These people made up the whole building feel much better by keeping there old culture around.
