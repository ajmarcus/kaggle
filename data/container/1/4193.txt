"The setting in the story was hot. The biker was sweating a lot. The whole town was empty. He pasted empty buildings. Their were rivers and big hills that he had to ride through. As it says about the buildings, Òsomehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.Ó The setting would affect the cyclist because their was no one in the town. Also, their was high hills."
