"The obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock they are making sure they dont bump into other buildings, and they use rope to drop down the papers. They are trying to make sure that the dirigibles do not pop if it touches the buildings. It is also trying to keep the dirigibles away so they don't get to close and thats why they are droping the papers down with ropes @CAPS1 if they built a little tunnel so the dirigibles can go in they won't have to worry about them getting popped if they touch a building."
