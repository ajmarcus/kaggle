"The mood in the memoir given by the author makes me think of my home. Overall, it makes you feel warm or happy inside. In the second paragraph when he is explaining his house and the music playing it automatically makes me think of my house around the holidays; like when the music is playing and you sing along matter how bad you are. You can tell that this book gives the reader a very positive mood or good ""vibe""."
