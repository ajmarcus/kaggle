"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders wanted to add a mooring mast top of the building, to allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling, or service, they couldn't do that because ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" Al Smith didn't get to allow the dirigibles to land on the building because of how skinny the top was."
