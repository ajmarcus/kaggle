"There is o good moud @CAPS1 to this @CAPS2. the mood is a warm, happy feeling. Whenyou read the @CAPS2 it makes you feel @CAPS4. Just like being at your own home. But only a little different. This time youare reading a @CAPS2. It really explains what is going On. It als o give s alot of past information. Which I like in a @CAPS2. But @PERSON1 seemed to really enjoy being cuban. @CAPS7 @CAPS5 to really like her Cuban food. Her family was good @CAPS6. The @LOCATION1 was a bad place when @CAPS7 was growing up asa child. The reason for this is because of racism and segregation. But other wise @CAPS7 has a good life."
