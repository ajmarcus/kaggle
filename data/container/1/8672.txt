"The @CAPS1 mood about the story is happy. The reason why is because the story talks aboult how the kid learns a lot of things from his young parents. The boy learns that @CAPS3 was born in cuba but @CAPS3 had to leave to New @CAPS2 even though @CAPS3 didn't want to. @CAPS3 also learns that his mom and that like to cook a lot together, @CAPS3 also learns that they make schedules for eachother. Even thougth they moved to New @CAPS2 they still do what they do in cuba and they let people visit even thougth they don't know them."
