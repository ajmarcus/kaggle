"The features of the setting affected the cyclist negitvly because he was in the desert in the summer with little water and no stones too get a drink at, For example he says ÒThere was no one in sight not a building, car, or structure of any kind's. This explains how his setting affected him because he had no where to go or get a drink. That is my reason why the cyclist settings where negitve."
