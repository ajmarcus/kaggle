"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there because dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles per hour.

Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mass. Also the body of the dirigibles they could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and off."
