"The mood created by the author in the memoir can be describe in many ways. The mood that the author created was confusing. Is confusing because I see more than one too many times. Some of the are happyness, proudness, sadness, and other ones. It's because the memoir talks about Narciso Rodriguez life. The mood created by the author can't be describe since there's too many."
