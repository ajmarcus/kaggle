"In the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie, depending how the main character feels, thats what the setting is like. When he got the next town and left he was feeling well because nothing was going wrong. The setting was very tranquil. The narrator says, The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them(Kurmaskie). This setting was very happy and pleasant just like the narrators mood."
