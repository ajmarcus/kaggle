"The mood of the memoir is very upbeat, happy mood of how @PERSON1. Grew up in Newark, New Jersey in a very Cuban family and tells the story of how Narciso went through his childhood. This memoir really emphasizes the connection and love that Narciso had with his parents and his home. It kind of makes you think that there is more to a house than just walls and a ceiling and that maybe it's part of a family."
