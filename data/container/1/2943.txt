"In ""The mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced was having to try and make it perfect, especially for the designers. They went through alot of work, effort, and time. They tried to make different arrangements for the government people. The dirigibles were always near the mooring mast. They were afraid that it would knock over one day. They also, wanted them to become the transportation of the future. The transportation was to the airplanes. The dirigibles became the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for the sightseers. So, their plans didn't quite work out as planned, but everything else seemed to work out okay."
