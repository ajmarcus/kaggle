"The features of the setting do affect the cyclist. If the road is rough you have to have the right bike. Then if you get a flat tire you have to know to look out for dangerous and posionous things. If you were in a real bad accident youd have to be prepared just in case they dont find you in time. You would have to know what nights were like. For example, if it got real cold at night you need to keep youself warm."
