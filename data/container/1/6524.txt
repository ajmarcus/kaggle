"The author concluded the story with this paragraph for one reason. That reason is because Saeng thinks she failed because she got a fake plant instead of a real one. She felt disappointed when she brought it home.  For example, she said “I failed,” talking about the plant. She also compares where she is now to where she used to live. For example, she said “its not like the one at home.” That’s why the author concludes this paragraph."
