"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very luring, like you read one sentence, then you want to read more. In the story, she says how her parent have to start their lives all over again. But, then she says that they're just happy to be together in good old @LOCATION1. Just because you have very little, doesn't mean you can't live it out the fullest. Be happy with what you got or don't have anything at all is what this story is telling me in my mind. So I will follow my life to the best like Narciso and her family did."
