"The features of the setting do indeed affect the cyclist. First in the story when describing the setting it says “there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” @CAPS1 basically giving a hint or foreshadow that something bad is going to happen because hes alone. Another description of the setting when it affects the cyclist when it says “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” @CAPS1 pretty much saying danger ahead, something bad will happen."
