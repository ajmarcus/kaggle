"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building was not easy. They had to draw out the plan for the mooring mast. The builders had to think about the thousand-foot dirigible that would be mooring at the top of the Empire State Building. They had to think about the wind pressure and of the load of the dirigible. The builders had to come up with brilliant ideas. The ideas were ""a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower"" (@CAPS1 paragraph @NUM1) on top of the building. Builders had to build and think of the elevators and stairs to bring the passengers of the dirigible to the eighty-sixth floor. The eighty-sixth floor had baggage and tickets. They would come from the one hundred second floor. The builders had a hard job because they had to think of ideas on how to build the mooring mast of the building They also had to think about, how to bring the passengers in and out of the dirigible. The builders faced obstacles as the construction of the building was in process."
