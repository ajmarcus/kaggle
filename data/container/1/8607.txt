"I think that the overall mood of the memoir is a thankful one. Towards the end he says ""I will always grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Also, he doesn't talk about the bad alot. He only briefly touches on it. For the rest of the memoir he is explaining how his life was wonderful, and that he always had family around him."
