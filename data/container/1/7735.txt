"The author set the mood in different ways Such as describing where he lived before he moved then when he told about his culture and him inheriting it then how he moved to @LOCATION1. He does not set the mood when he talks about his parents being selfish. The biggest part of the mood is talking about where he lived at first, where and what he had. He might have a good start with mood if he told more about the kind of education he got whether he was in Cuba or @LOCATION1. The mood was an overall ok because more about his life but the memoir was not a complete success. But as long as he had a satisfied, happy, organized life it was a good tone of mood."
