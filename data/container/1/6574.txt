"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is not going to give up until she successfully passes the task he mother gives her.Saeng fails the test because, though she buys a beautiful plant it is much to expensive. But how could you? All the seeds for this vegetable garden didnt cost that much! Saeng becomes very upset and realizes that she has failed her mother. Saeng still plants the winter hibiscus in the ground. Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the winter hibiscus into it. This shows that even though she had failed she wasnt going to give up on the hibiscus because it represented her home. It was very special to her."
