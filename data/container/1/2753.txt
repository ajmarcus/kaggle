"Throughout the excerpt, on trying to build the empire state building; the builders faced a lot of hard attempts trying to build the dock for the dirigibles. One major problem is that the dirigible was not able to land on the buildings flat roof. This was stated in paragraph @NUM1 of the excerpt. Another problem is that they had to design elevators and stairs for the passengers to travel to the top of the building to be able to get on the dirigible. Along with designing stairs they had to be able to build 102 floors just for the area where the blimp would land. This can be supported in paragraph 11 and @NUM2 of the reading. After trying to build the big building, the builders ran into major safety concers towards the end of the making. The builders did not think they would run into any problems or think of the safety."
