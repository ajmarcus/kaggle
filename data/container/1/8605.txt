"The mood in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is very subtle and can be undefind. I say this because when I read this I didn't feel anything @CAPS1 I thought about it. The article gave off a very comfortting mood. As he said in the memoir ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" at nothing to do being blood relative."" (@CAPS2 in the beginning paragraph @NUM1) That quote sets a mood where a little audience in your head goes ""@CAPS3 I never thought of that way before."" This memoir does not give out blunt moobs like happy or sad, It makes you think. There was never a really sad moment in the whole thing. At the end of paragraph @NUM2 he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote is another example of giving a very undefind mood, I say it is undefind because you just cant put it into words of how you feel. So in conclusion the mood this piece gives is undefind."
