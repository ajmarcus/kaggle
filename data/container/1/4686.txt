"The setting affects the cyclist by showing that he is a little angry. He states that dont remember the saying dont take candy from strangers. So we know he is upset about something. He is mad about the fact that this one older man tells him directions on how to get somewhere, and its wrong. The man figure that out halfway through the story. He also said that the old man hasnt been off his porch since Carter was in office, so he needs to get his directions up to date. So the beginning is a negative attitude."
