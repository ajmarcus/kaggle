"I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph to leave us with hope. Saeng is going to retake the test she failed. Saeng is having a hard time adjusting to her new life, by waiting until the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, Saeng gives herself time to adapt and heal. The paragraph shows Saengs courage and hope about retaking the test."
