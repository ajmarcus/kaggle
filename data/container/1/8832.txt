The mood in the memoir is peaceful and loving The reason why it is peaceful is because there is no fighting in this story at all. This story is loving because throughout the whole thing the only thing that I learned about was how to respect and love each other. There are many examples of this in paragraph @NUM1 and paragraph @NUM2. This is the tone of the story.
