"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our loves the author creates a mood in the memoir. The mood that he creates is a relaxed and laid-back mood.The way the author writes is very smooth for example ""in 1961 I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey."" That is a very relaxed sentence.He then goes on about his life. He tells about his neighborhood, family, religion and much more. Towards the end he tells what he is grateful for.The author told this story as if he was being interviewed and he was very relaxed and layed back."
