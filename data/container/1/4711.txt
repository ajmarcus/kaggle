"The cyclist is affected by the heat, the hills, and the lack of people. For example, the cyclist was growing short on water and had wide rings of dried sweat on his on shirt, and he could drop from heatstroke. The hills must have forced him to use more energy, and lasely  the land of people. If the towns still had people the cyclist wouldnt have been as affected by the setting."
