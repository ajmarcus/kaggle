"Saeng said that when the tree she bought starts budding she will take the test over. She means that without that plant she just does not feel like taking the test. She does not because the plant was with her, her whole life. She also thinks that she can not do it, without that plant. Saeng means that since she’s had a plant like that her whole life then she thinks she needs it, but I don’t think she really needs it. I guess it just “comforts” her."
