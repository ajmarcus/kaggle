"This is the mood created by the author in this memoir. In this memoir the author states""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". One reason why this describes the author's mood is that it shows that through all the great times he's had with his family, they have giving him an experience of a life time that he will never forget. Another reason why this shows the author's mood is that now that his parents have died and he misses them the only memory he has of them is this house he calls home. That is how the author describes his mood a lot in this memoir."
