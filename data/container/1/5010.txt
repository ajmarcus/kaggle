"The features of the setting have affected the cyclist in Do not exceed posted speed limit"" greatly, first he statrs off happy because hes going to Yosemite national park and hed gotten short cut advice that would make his trip shorter. ""He rode into the morning with strong legs, Then he got to the first stop. It looked like a buzzing town at one time, but now a ghost town. So he kept on with plenty of water and thought he could make it to the next stop. The next stop was an old abandoned gas station where the only water was @NUM1. He was hitting the water pretty regular and the hot sun was beating down on him. The next terrain changed he thought he would die & have the vultures pick his bones because he took advice from old timers, then became to his next stop which seemed to be an old welchs grape juice factory. He thought he would die of thirst but he kept on with little water a hot sun. next the hills came & he paced himself a little time, then he finally came to a modern looking place with cool running water with an old man who gave him directions that he gladly took. After that he been through asuring himself he would die he was relieved to see the old mans there he would forever on listen to their advice because he made it."
