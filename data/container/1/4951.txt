"The setting is a desert in California in June, this affects the cyclist because it is very hot and he only has a couple drinks of water. There is no place for the cyclist stop and get more water. He says, there is no one in sight, not a building,car, or structure of any kind. As you can see that kind of setting would definetly affect the cyclist."
