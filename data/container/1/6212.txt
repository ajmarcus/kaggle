In the story winter Hibiscus Saeng is fond of Beautiful flowers that once grew in her home land. Her favirte flower was the winter Hibiscus that had beautiful red pedals on it as of velvet. She also failed a test that she had taken so what the story is trying to say is that nothing can be as good as whats at home but sometimes you just need another chance at something.
