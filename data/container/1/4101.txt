"Condition the cyclist is in affect a lot of how they ride. One example of this is, “I was travelling through the high desert of California in June.” @CAPS1 to this fact the cyclist had went into a “dehydrated state” because of not having much water. When your travelling in hot weather areas without much water your body will become dehydrated from sweating. Cycling in different conditions will affect cyclists diffently."
