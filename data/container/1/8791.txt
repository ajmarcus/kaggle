"In the memoir, ""@PERSON1"" from Home: The @CAPS1 prints of our Lives the mood created by the author is that he wasn't happy moving to @LOCATION1 at first but after being in a home with his loving family he liked it. Even though he had to work and he was an immaigrant he was happy. The only reason he was happy was because he was with his family and thats what is important to him. He was from Cuba and immigrated from Cuba to @LOCATION1. The mood of the story is not happy, happy, and sad. this is what the mood created by the auther is."
