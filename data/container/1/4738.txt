" The story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by @PERSON1 had some statements that we were kind of pointless to put in. One of sentence in the essay had a couple word that don’t need to be used. In the sentence, about forty miles into the pedal, I arrive at the first “town,” I don’t think “into the pedal needs to be in there because its not describing anything."
