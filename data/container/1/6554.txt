"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng said she failed the test, and when spring comes back then she will take the test again. The last paragraph reads when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. She really does not tell us what test she is supposed to be taking."
