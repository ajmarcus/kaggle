"The story includes this paragraph because at the very beginnig of the story the girl failed the test. And so when she told her mother she saw that she was upset with it. So after they planted the plant she decided to take the test over knowing that her mother would think the best of it. Also its in there because the story started out with her telling her mother that she failed the test.  And if you kept it out people who read it would be like, ok, so her mother just let her fail the test and didnt do anything about it. Plus when the reader reads that the girl failed the test, they are going to be wanting to know if she took it again, and why she took it again if she did."
