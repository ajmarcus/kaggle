"I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph because shes showing she is trying she wants another chance. She realized her mistakes and ready to start over, Even though she faild by trying to grow her hibiscus in the winter she is trying to start over when the @DATE1 comes in. for example in the story. It stated the ""winter hibiscus"" was in the ground now, and saeng tamped down the soil around it over head, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and yes familiar to saeng snow. That is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph."
