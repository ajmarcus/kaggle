"I think the author finish the story with this paragraph for the following reasons. Saeng really means she will take the test in spring. I say that because she says when the snow melt and geese return meaning next spring she will take the test again. She is saying with confidence because she started to add more. For example, she added hibiscus is budding. Saeng is determined to past the test just by what she is saying. This is why it was the last paragraph and what she meant by it."
