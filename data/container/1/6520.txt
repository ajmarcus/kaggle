"The author of Winter Hibiscus ended the story with the paragraph, when they came back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snowsmelt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She did this because she bought the flower when she failed the test so when the flower blooms she will take the test again."
