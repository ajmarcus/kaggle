The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a few reasons. One of the reason is so the reader could imagein what rest of the story would be like if it continued. For example when the author said “then I will take that test again.” Another reason is to give the reader one last good image to change their thought of the story. For example when the author said “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding”. Those were reasons why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.
