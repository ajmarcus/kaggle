"I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she fells to live the geese and her memories relate to the times she sees the geese. I think that her test is in school but she has believe that she’ll pass it by remembering her memories she fells conected to the outside ness. For example, she loves flowers. Thats why I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph."
