"In the memoir, the author tells us all about his family and friends and his backround. He tells us that the way he grew up effected him all his life. He loved his parents and relatives and friends and his home. He even loved his Cuban heritage. In this entire memoir there is nothing but happiness and good attitude from the author. He lets us know that home is where the heart is and that he would'nt trade his childhood life for anything."
