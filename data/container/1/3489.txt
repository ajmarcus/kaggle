"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A huge obstacle was that some dirigibles were as long as @NUM1 feet, the same length as four blocks in New York. Another obstacle was the expanded use. New York was the lack of suitable landing area they would have. With this Al Smith saw opportunity for his building. He would add a morning mast to the top of the building that would allow passengers on and off, which would then become a spot for refueling or service. But with this new idea there would have to be lots of planing."
