"The setting in the story “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” really goes against the cycilist and his journey. This is because in the places he goes there is no water and if there is it is really hot or bad water. For example, on page @NUM1 it says, “a tarlike substance oozed out, but the water wouldn’t cool down,” This explains how bad the water was when the cycilist was there."
