"The setting affects the cyclist in a large way. He has a hard time going on his journey. He began to lose hope, get tired, and began to think he was going to die. The settings played the biggest role. It was very hot with no people or buildings around him. He had very little water and no place to get anymore. He then encountered a large snake which made it worse because he was in fear with no one around to help him. If he would have followed his own directions instead of the old men he would not have had this problem. The setting around him really made his trip a hard one with no water, people, towns, or buildings around him."
