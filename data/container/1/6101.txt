The author concludes the story with the saying because it shows that she has confent in her self because she did not pass the test she could take it again and know she can pass the test she was up set about it her mother when she talk to her made her feel good and confent to do or retake the test and know she could pass the test so that why I think the author concludes it with that saying at the end of the story.
