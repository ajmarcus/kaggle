"In the story, “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the setting is an all- important factor. The author feels the need to describe the path that the cyclist is following and the details each place he stops, such as in “one ramshackle shed…and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule…” and “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite…” In a story such as this setting is of great importance especially since it is so rapidly changing. The story itself would be of much different quality likely for a lower quality, if the author never put emphasis on the areas that the cyclist rode past, this story would not be worth reading if the author were not as skilled a writer as he is."
