"Architects struggled with obstacles as they were constructing the Empire State Building. A @NUM1 ft. dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, which would add stress to the building's frame. The Architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. The observation area was to double as the boarding area for dirigible passengers. Once the building had been framed, the roof had to be completed before the framing of the mooring mast could take place. The mast had a skeleton of steel and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it's purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."
