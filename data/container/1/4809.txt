"Features of the cyclist affected the cyclist in many ways. One was the heat. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June. @CAPS1 that California is called, the sunshine state, I can infer that it was very hot. Another feature that affected the cyclist was when he thought he could get some water but it was hot and tasted like battery acid. This is said in. This is said in paragraph @NUM2. This is how features of the setting affected the cyclist."
