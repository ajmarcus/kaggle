"The mood of the memoir is happy. I know this because the Rodriguez family crossed the border from Cuba to the United States to have a better life. They came in 1956, but had to wait until 1970 to be reunited with their Aunts and @CAPS1. They now have a bigger house. They are grateful they live in the United States."
