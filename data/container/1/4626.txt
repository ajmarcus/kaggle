In the poem Do not exceed speed limit the setting is described as very rough and dry. The man on the bike says he was running low on water. At one point he says At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridi culously large shake This makes the setting sound dry and empty with a harmful snake around. this  man also said about a sign which read Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit this also made it hard for the man to ride. These are the settings that affected the biker in the story.
