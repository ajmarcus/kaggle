"In his memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a reflective and relaxed mood about his memories. For example, his use of parentheses create a voice for him through which the reader can better understand what he is trying to say. Also, by reflecting positiely on old times, it feels as if the author is right here next to the reader, having a pleasant conversation. For example, when he is talking about his landlord's daughter, @LOCATION1, he mentions how she would often grace his table with her presence.Furthermore, by describing the enviroment of his apartment, it feels to the reader most as if we are sitting in a wood backed chair listening to the sweet saranade of an unamed Cuban singer. The smell of spices lingers in the air, The smoke from a stove waters the eye's as it drifts lazily out the window. The sound of engines and the beep of horns created by the low roar of a bus plays in the backround. The bright reds, oranges, and yellows of the furniture burn pleasantly in the eyes. This reflective and relaxed mood is so important for the author to get his stories across, and Narciso Rodriguez does it well."
