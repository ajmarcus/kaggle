"The features in the setting affecting the cyclist because of the heat and the terrain. I say this because in the story it describes all the hills that he has to go up and down with the herendous heat beating down on him. The heat also makes it hard because it makes you drink more and throughout the story he was trying to find some water, and the water he did find was about Òtwo hundred degrees and tasted like a battery acid.Ó If you have no water that makes it very hard to bicycle that far of a distance in that much heat."
