The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the he was traveling through a hot place at a hot time of year and didnt have much water. In the text it says I was traveling the high desserts of California in June. The deserts are always hot and June is a very hot month. The cyclist was getting thirsty quicker from the heat and wasnt able to drink much because he had limited water.
