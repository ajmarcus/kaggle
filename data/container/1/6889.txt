I think the author concludes this story wit this ending paragraph because the story is all about how  she feels comforted in the plants and she wants to wait until the weather breaks and the geese to come back to take her test. I think she wants to wait that way she will be more comfortable with her surroundings and she can clear her mind and do her best on the test.
