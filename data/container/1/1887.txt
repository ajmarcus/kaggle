"Obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were some of the following. They needed an exact way of getting everything perfect for the job. The whole building process for this job was very complicating and needed the best expertese.In paragraph @NUM1, Al Smith's quote greatly backs up to my point. He says ""one set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to the mast"". It tells just how much people are working on this job.In conclusion, this was a complicated job. They weren't positive if the mast even be able to stay. They also werent positive if the fluids inside would be but a problem factor."
