"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy because he was always gratefull for everything his parents had done for him (Narciso Rodriguez). My opinion-I think that Narciso Rodriguez had told us students and adults a little bit of his life because he might want people to understand what he had went through in his life, and see how he got this way and how he got to Where he is today or now."
