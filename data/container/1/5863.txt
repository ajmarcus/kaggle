"I  think  the  author  ended  this  story  like  that  because  it  means  that  she  hasent gave up yet and even though she failed the  first time she is come try again, In the spring , when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding . mean that when all is @CAPS1 . She will try to do it again because if she passes it will be @CAPS1. The story was preety bad because I dont even know what she  failed  so I didnt  like it."
