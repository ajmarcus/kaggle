"In the artical ""The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the obstacles the builders of the empire Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical workable arrangement and the government people in washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast. The architects couldnot simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State buildings flat roof. A thousand- foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frames. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over Sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."
