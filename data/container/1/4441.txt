"The cyclist in the story is running into a lot of problems in this story. For example, the cyclist is out in the summer heat in California riding a bike. After several minutes of this, you will become thirsty. The cyclist brought water but after constant sweating the water supply has nearly ran out. Not having enough water can cause a person to become deyhdrated which then can cause them to pass-out and possibly die. So as you can see, the cyclist is affected by the setting in the story. He has been affected negatively by the heat and by the lack of water."
