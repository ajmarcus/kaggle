"The features of the selling effect the cyclist a lot. One factor that would effect the cyclist would be the heat. Also, because of this factor, hes pobably suffering from lack of water. Hes probably really hot seeing hes the only one cut in the middle of nowhere for what looks like miles. Another feature of the setting that would probably effect the cyclist is the thought of there @MONTH1 be a car around this next turn. If he cant see around the next turn he doesnt know is coming. The cyclist could also be thinking about when the next town will show up."
