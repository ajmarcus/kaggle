The author concludes the story with Saeng vowel to show a sense of change in Saeng. The winter time is very brutal like Saeng’s mum said but spring is when things come alive. I think is showing the sense in Saeng. Though winter is tough and you @MONTH1 get them trown around by the wind. When spring comes she will try the test again and come to life and enjoy the @LOCATION1 even thagh that she is far from rain. The author did the right thing to conclude the story with that vowel.
