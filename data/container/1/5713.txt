The author ends the story with this paragraph because he wants the reader to feel like she is going to accomplish something because of the hibiscus and the geese. An example of her accomplishing something because of hibiscus is when the author mentions how her and her grandmother use to spend time together and do things together and her grandmother would do her hair and then put a hibiscus flower into it. Also the geese are a sing of accomplishment because she sees them in the sky flying south so they can survive the cold winter months in a warm place.
