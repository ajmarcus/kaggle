While building the Empire state building people had to go through some obstacle to have it the way they want. They wanted Dirigibles to be able land/bord on the Empire state building. One of there obstacles was the use in New York City and a lack of suitable landing area. The other obstacle was a good one. The use of Dirigibles for the mooring mast was successful.
