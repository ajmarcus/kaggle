The features of the setting affect the cyclist because in paragraph @NUM1 it say that the temperture was was getting high and that when he drank the water that it test like battery acid. This would affect him because it it was so hot and the water was starting to get hot how would he be able to get through the day with out pasing out also in paragraph @NUM2 it say the roads changed to hill when you ride up and down the hills you become tired from pumping you legs then you would feel hot and tiredd and would not want to ride the bike. That how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.
