"In my opinon I felt like his culture ment a lot to him and I felt that her house and family and friends was all important to him. In the frist paragraph he describes his family, where they lived where they came from, how old was they and it made me think about my culture and family. In the second paragraph it tells what year she was born in and how his house was and I wanted to describe my old house the only house with more memories then I could think of. His neighborhood is a close tight community with honest hard working immigrants. It made me think about how all are community could be if we was hard working. In my opinon her memories made my memories come back."
