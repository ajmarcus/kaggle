"I think Saeng concluded with this story because there is always time to make up for the past if the past allows you to meaning that @CAPS1 didnt past the test. I fell she met that in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, to me this means that even though it is snowing outside there is always next spring to start growing back up the vegetable garden this also relates to Saeng even though she failed the test there is always another change we can make up for that lost and retry and try to succeed at this one."
