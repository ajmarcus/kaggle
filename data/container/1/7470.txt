"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a grateful one. Because it is telling you what his experience in life was, and what his parents were like. It is also my opinion that they liked where they were. One reason is because they liked to cook all the time. Another reason is that they liked to have fun with their son One last reason is because they had a son. Their @CAPS1 name was @PERSON1."
