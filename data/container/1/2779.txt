"The builders faced many challenging obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the empire state building. The builders first talked about such as Al Smith to try to make the Empire State building the tallest building in the state, so it would be a great forefront for travelers, and they got it up high to @NUM1 feet. But now there obstacle was to have a dirigible reach the top point of the empire state building. Al Smith wanted for the top of the empire state building to be a landing area, where they could go refueling for hours, or service, and to let passengers on or off the dirigible. So that was one of the obstacles that the builders had to face, to make it work."
