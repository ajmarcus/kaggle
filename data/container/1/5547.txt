"The author concludes the story with this paragraph, because it's important to the story. Also it closes the story up. Its exploning that the girl is starting to adjust to the new area, and is going to try harder to get along well there. So by saying shes going to take the test again. It means shes going to look at it in a new way. The authur put this at the end trying to make sense of everything and show the girl had changed."
