"The biker has many features in his story. For example he has discriptive words that put pictures into my head. For example “One long, crippling hill” I can picture it in my head. “There was no one in sight.” All of these parts of the story put pictures in my head. Thats a good thing, for example you want the reader to understand it, and by having discribing words help."
