"The builders faced a lot of obstacles when building the empire state Building. They had to build it higher than any other building, but make sure its stable at the same time. They also had to make the top of the building perfectly or else the dirigibles would not be able to land. Eventually it was safe enough for the dirigibles to land and the people could get off and take a tour of the top part of the building."
