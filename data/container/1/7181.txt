"The mood in the memoir is very adventorous. In the memoir it showed how Narciso's parent's and relatives moved. At first Narciso lived in a furnished one-room apartment, then they could afford to move into a modest three-room apartment that was soon to be Narciso's home. Narciso was born in 1961, in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Narciso grew up with his family for a while. ""Family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Narciso will always be greatful and loving to his parents for what they did for him."
