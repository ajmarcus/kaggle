"The setting of this story affects the cyclist alot. I think the setting was supposed to be most like a run-down out of dated town which didnt help him when he was lost. The town is out of date and hot. Which bring another problem, the cyclist was dehydrating because he didnt have enough water. He would hilusinate and see things that werent there. He become very tired in the hot sun. So the setttling in this short stories effected the cyclist in many ways."
