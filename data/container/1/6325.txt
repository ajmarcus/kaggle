"After reading the quote ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test. From the story ""winter' Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, I think the author is trying to say that after the winter and fall pass she will be upto the challenge to plant again and feel good about herself. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive ""V"" was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance. Reflecting back I feel Saeng felt that the geese was secretly letting her know what she was doing was right."
