"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, I believe she concludes the story in this way to show that even though Saeng failed the test, she will try again someday, someday being symbolized by when the geese come back. Saeng is sad because she missis her homeland and she sees plants that bringback memories, so she buys a winter hibiscus to ease & comfort her & remind her of home."
