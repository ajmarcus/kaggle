"In the memoir there is alot of differet moods such as mad, sad, hopefull. I think that over all it is a happy memoir because in the story is says ""and for which I am eternally gratefull"". and also ""Which I adored to this day."" @CAPS1 I think that over all it is a happy mood, because there is alot of evidence to help support it."
