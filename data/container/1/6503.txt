"In the story “the Winter Hibiscus"", I think the author uses the last paragraph to show that although the memories  of  her old country would always be with her but she soon will adapt to her new one. Also from time to time she still will visit her old country. For example “when the show melts and the geese return"", The last sentences, then I will take the test again”, This sentence means that once she is adapted to this country on goes back to her old one she still will enjoy their either way."
