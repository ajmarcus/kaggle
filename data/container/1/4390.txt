"The features of this particular setting affected the cyclist in many different ways. Upon arriving at the “ghost town” early in his journey, he felt slight amusement at the situation. But he soon became very troubled when he became aware of the several rusty pumps and a weak corral, next to a ramshackle shed. The cyclist additionally experienced a bit of irony as he approached the 55 mph speed limit sign complete with a warning to strictly obey it. On his bicycle, at a pace of 12 mph, he could not even reach the 55 mph speed if he had wanted to. Before he reached what appeared to be an abandoned welch’s Grape Juice factory, the cyclist felt this twisted amusement yet again, as he laughed. The text states, “It was a sad hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” @CAPS1, his suffering was through when he discovered a “fish camp,” with a modern bathroom and working sinks. The cyclist’s relief was so immense that he,” had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber (the owners), (and) kiss them."
