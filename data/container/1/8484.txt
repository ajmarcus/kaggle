My mood while reading this memoir written by the author was a little bittersweet. It talked about sweet little things that were sad but sometimes happy. They talked about sacrifice so much in this memoir. And it feels like they all have to grow up faster because it is so different than our lives ane they are more gratefull then us even though they have like not as much. And it sounds like everyone gets along so easily and yet they make do with all they have. It really touched my heart.
