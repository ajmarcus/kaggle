To me the mood of the author is happy. Thinks he's happy because in the article it talks about how he grow up and where he lived through his entire life. Also it talks about when Narciso Rodriguez arrived in the United States which was in 1956. Plus it talks about how he helped the poor people in his own country before he moved to the US. Narciso Rodriguez did alot of stuff to help his country survive before he left.
