"The biggest obsticle was safely. The foriegn dirigibles use Hydrogen (@NUM1) gas as a means to fly but hydrogen gas is highly flamable. The owners of the Empire State Building were consernd because of what happened to the German dirigible, Hindenburg, over Lakehurst, @LOCATION2. The Hindenburg bursted into flames and in less than one minute there was no dirigible, just some charred scrap metal. If this incident were to happen in a highly populated area like downtown New York City it would create a high number of casualties and fatalities."
