"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. Ranging from temperature, surroundings, and the availability of water. First of all, the cyclist felt tired and exhausted because of the temperature and terrain, For example, I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. I can imagine the cruelty of the heat beating down on him while riding down the roads. It would make me tired and exhausted also. Second of all, the surroundings as he rode affected him and made him have less confidence as he rode further. For example, This place might have been a thriving little spetatore time say, before the last world war-last on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. It shows how the information he had been giving caused him to feel unsure of where he was going. Id feel uncapable and would do the same in his situation. Lastly, the lack of water made him scared. For example, conserve my water and go instead for an hour or so a lest of my inner spirit. It made him think the situation wasnt good. So as one can see, it affected the cyclist in many ways."
