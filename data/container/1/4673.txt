The features of the setting affected the cyclist. For example their was not towns close near. One reason this affected the cyclist is because if the towns were near each other if he ran out of water there would be stores close by. In addition he could have a heatstroke and there would be no one around to get help from and he could easily die. In my point of view of the reading I believe where he was located is what affected him mostly.
