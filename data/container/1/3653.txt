"The setting affects the  author alot. First he is in a California desert in the middle of June. It is very hot out. This makes the cyclist very tired. There are some cool pines, but they do help much. There is also no where to get water for a very long time. The narration states, I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). With no water the cyclist was dehydrated. This hurt his biking skills like balance and led stregth. Finally there was no one around for most of the story. The cyclist did not know how far he had to go until he reached @CAPS1 or water. There was also no one  to help him if he were to have a heat stroke."
