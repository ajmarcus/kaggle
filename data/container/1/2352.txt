"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were to build a structure with a stable enough top to be able to hold a dirigible. Once the Chrysler Building became taller than the Empire State Building, however, the idea of dirigibles slowly faded away, unnoticed. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, Al Smith said he would put a top or hat on the building to make it taller. The only problem is that instead of dirigibles docking there, they would just sit next to the point of the building. If Smith wasnt so competitive, the blimps would have a nice platform to dock on."
