"The mood created by the author in the memoir was grateful, happy, and thankful. The author was grateful because he wasn't asked to be born in america, hes parents immigranted to america so that Narciso can live a better life. Narciso was happy because he get to see both of his parents, his grandparents which lives in the basement of his house, and his aunts Bertha and Juanita and his cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary. Narciso was thankful because he gets a home where he can sleep at, a family who loves him, and he could've ask for nothing better than the life he has now."
