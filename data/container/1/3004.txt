"On the excerpt there were a lot of obstacles on the atempt of Building the Empire State Building and making it safe to dock dirigibles. The first obstacle to building the Empire State building was that the engeier Al Smith wanted to make the Empire State building, ""the world's tallest building."" ""When the Empire State building was conceived, it was planed as the world's tallest building, taller even then the new Chrysler building that was being constructed."" (@CAPS1 1) the proble was that the architector of the Chrysler Building put a 185 ft spire inside the building. Al Smith got an idea that would make the Empire State Building taler and beater. His idea would be more than a ""ornament"" ""their top, the said, would selrve a higher calling. The Empire State building would be equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers."" He believed that he could use the building as a dock for dirigible, so people could get on and off. The proble was that that the frame would not work. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State building was destined to never fulfill its purpose."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) They attempted to land dirigibles @NUM2 times but they weren't able to do it at the end. ""In December 1930, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough."" (@CAPS1 @NUM3) They could not fix the problem."
