"The author concluded the story with that paragraph because it leaves you to interpret and decide. It doesnt come out  and tell you what the test was for or even if she passed it, thats for you to decide. It also leaves you wondering what is going to happen until then. The ending to the story can be anything you want it to be, it is up for interpretation. To different people it could mean different things."
