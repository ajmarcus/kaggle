"I think the author ended the story with that phrase to show that she wont give up; no matter how hard it is she keeps trying. The girl says in the story ÒI failed the test,Ó and then at the end of the story says I will take that test again so she is not willing to fail forever. I also think the author ended the story with that paragraph to make you wonder if she will ever pass the test."
