"After sometime into his trip he mentioned ÒI was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.Ó I believe that this setting had gotten him determined to keep on pedaling so he could live. But then he started to think he might die, but he wasnt sad or upset, he was happy. He had sort of chuckled to himself, because of the fact that he might die because he listend to some old men. In my opinion I think he was having the time of his life peddeling through this setting of California."
