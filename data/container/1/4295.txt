The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if its raining or snowing it affects the cyclist because pavement can be wet and icy. Which causes the cyclist to slip and @DATE1 and the cyclist can really get injured. Also the cyclist has to wear a helmet if its very hot outside you wouldnt see the cyclist in winter clothes. This would make the cyclist unfocus and the cyclist wouldnt be able to finish any race.
