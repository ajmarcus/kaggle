"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show maybe by this time she will be comfortable with her new home. I know this because when I moved i didn’t like it because I didn’t have many friend but in like a year or two I was fine because I had a lot of friend. This is like Saeng because she misses her old home because she keeps talking about it then crying for example, when see saw the plant it was the one she had at her old home and she started crying because she missed it. In conclusion that is why he put that at the end of the story."
