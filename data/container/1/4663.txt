"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. Since the cyclist was in the middle of no where, he couldnt get any water. Id read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst, he was so thirsty that he barely had any energy to keep going, The growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke, it was hot out and he had no water so this affected his energy."
