"the obstacles the builders of the empire state @CAPS1 face. was that their expanded use in @LOCATION1 was the lack of a suitable landing erea. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his empire state Building.A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passangers off and on. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast."
