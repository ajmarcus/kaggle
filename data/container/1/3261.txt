"There are many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle the builders had to face was they had ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to be made to the building's framework."" Another obstacle the builders faced was meeting the president of a airship transport company and the plan to offer dirigible service across the Pacific Ocean. That is just two of the many obstacles the builders faced while building the Empire State Building."
