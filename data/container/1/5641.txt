I believe that why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because she is telling the reader and herself In my point of view that once again she do work in the garden to see if it catches her interest. I believe that the author is trying to express this because in the beggining of the story the author shows no interest in the garden or any interest of the world around her. For example when she was supposed to buy just seeds for the garden she went and used some of her mothers money to buy herself a big mac. So In conclusion I believe that what I wrote clearly states how the author feels and why she ended they story the way she did.
