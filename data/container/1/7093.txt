"The mood in the memoir that the author creates is a very warm and relaxed sort of mood. The way the author tells you about his parents; the selflessness and the way they put their kids first before themselves really just makes you think about your own parents and how good they are to you and what they would do for you. The way the author talks about his home makes you think of all the colors in the house. I think that the house would be a golden Ð red color yellow, white, brown and orange on the insides. It reminds me of the way they would have cooked. They would have cooked with colorful peppers, onions, tortillas and oils. It makes you think about what colors you have in your home and what you would cook with.  The music sounds wonderful. Even though they don't demonstrate what it actually sounds like, you can easily imagine it. I imagine it laying in the background while all the adults are cooking and the kids are playing in colorful rooms with the golden sunlight shining in through an open window. I love the mood that this memoir puts me in."
