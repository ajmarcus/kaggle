"The mood in ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"", by Narciso Rodriguez, is warming and caring. From this memoir you can tell there was a lot of love, understanding, patience, and gratitude in this family. He was greatly affected by his parents selflessness and I'm sure he will be as loving and wonderful to his own family because of what they taught him."
