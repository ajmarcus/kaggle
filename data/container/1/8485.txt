"The mood in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez is appreciation for what you have. An example of appreciation is in @CAPS1 @NUM1 when he states ""After living for a year in a furnished oneroom apartment, @NUM2-year-old Rawedia Maria and @NUM3-year-old @ORGANIZATION1 could afford to move into a modest three room apartment I would soon call my home"". This shows that he is happy to have whatever he can get. Another example is throughout the memoir he always talks about all the problems they have had but is still grateful for everything they have growing up. This is how the mood in the story is appreciation"
