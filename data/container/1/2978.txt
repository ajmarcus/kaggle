"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders faced one giant obstacle. They faced the risk of blowing up the building. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This is one example from the excerpt that could turn into the biggest obstacle. If one were to explode above this building then the building would die. Also a lot of people would die from it too. That is one of the biggest obstacles they faced."
