In the essay I can conclude that there were many features of the land that affected the cyclist. For example in the text it states ridiculously large snakeblocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. If you are greatly afraid of snakes that could ruin your whole trip. The cyclist was scared but over came the fear and moved on. Also another thing that changed the cyclist was the lack of water. Not having enough water could be bad. As stated I could drop from heatstore on a gorgeous day in June There are many features that effected the cyclist and his journey.
