"The author concludes the story with this paragraph. “Where Saeng vowed silently to herself,” in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscun is budding, then I will take that test again.

Apperantly this things could be found after the snows melt and the geese reture and hibiscus is budding."
