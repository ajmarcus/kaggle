The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to let the readers know that how Saeng @CAPS1 about the hibiscus. I thinks the author concludes this because he his telling the reader that the hibiscus gives saeng goodluck and with this good luck She will past the test. In the story it tells us how much saeng adores the plant For example when she got to the hibiscus She reached out and toched a petal gently. It Felt smooth and cool. Thats why the author use thal paragraph at the end to indicate how Saeng @CAPS1 and how it make her  feel confident.
