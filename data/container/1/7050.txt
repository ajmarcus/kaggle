"I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph, because when the snow melts and the geese return, she going to have higher confidence in taking and passing the test. After she failed the test later on in the story the geeses had flew away. So when the geese return the geese will remind her of what had just now happened. When the snow melts and spring comes the hibiscus flower will bloom once again."
