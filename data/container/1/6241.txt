"The author concludes this story with “when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again because Saeng didnt past her test and knew her mom would be mad so that why she got the flower. If she wouldn’t have failed her test she probably wouldn’t have got the flower in the first place."
