"The feature of the setting affect the cyclist because the surrounding is so negative. Everything around the cyclist is percieved negatively, so the naturally the cyclist feels like the task is harder and more challenging than it really is. For example, nothing is surrounding the cyclist but sand and the hot temperature since the setting is so empty and no one is around, then everything seems harder than it really is. Also the cyclist feels like he cant go on and is weak because there is no living he around him. Furthermore, if the cyclist was in the park with the sun shining and people around and in sight, his attitude would change and everything would seem easier."
