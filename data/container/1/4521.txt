"In the story “Rough Road ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” a cyclist is faced with many problems. It’s really hot out, practically a desert and its in June. Just knowing that makes me want some water. Also this cyclist is running short of water and still hasn’t got to the place he needs to be. The roads are hills and bumpy which make it harder for him. Those are the problems this cyclist is faced with."
