The mood in the memoir is very calm. It's not very tense and depressing. An example of it being calm is in paragraph @NUM1 when the words are in the parentheses it's like the person is talking to you. Also how it Just states facts and a @CAPS1. Another example of it being calm is how the @CAPS1 is happy and not sad. It has a flow to it.
