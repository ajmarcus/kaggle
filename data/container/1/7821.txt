"The mood created by the author in the memoir is nice, and calm. It describs How the famialy let people in their house with open arms and a open door and  that makes me and mybe other people seem the mood is nice. The mood is calm because  it talks about this famialy doing nice thing and there is no yelling no fighting and I find the to be nice, and calm."
