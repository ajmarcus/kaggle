"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted, describes complicated obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles was competition. ""It was planned as the world's tallest building taller even than the new Chrysler Building,"" (@CAPS1 1). ""Al Smith realized that he was close to losing the title of world's tallest building"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). There was a competition as to had the tallest building between the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. Another obstacle, was the safety and dirigibles. ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in lakehurts, New Jersey, The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populate area such as down town New York."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). The owner didn't want to risk a accident to cost people's life it would have been bad rep for them. The obstacles that the builders went through was a positive thing, it made them @CAPS2 and open their eyes."
