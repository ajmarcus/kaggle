"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the story ends with saying “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” The reason the author ends the story like that is because it showing that eves though she @MONTH1 of failed the test once shes not going to give up just because of as adjustment change. The Hibiscus made the reader relize that a plantation where she lives can adapt so can she. "
