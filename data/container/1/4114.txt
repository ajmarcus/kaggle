"The cyclist is effected by the setting in ÒRough Road Ahead"" because the road is a place and if it is rough or unknown, its a direct effect on the traveler, who is the cyclist. If it is a hill then the cyclist would have to climb it. In the text it said , Òover a long crippling hill,Ó the crippiling hill part stresses that the setting is a hill."
