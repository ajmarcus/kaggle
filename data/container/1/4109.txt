"The features of the setting affected the authors story a lot. It affected it by making the trip seem more difficult to the reader. This was made possible by telling how hot it was and explaining how the road was full of bumps or hills. The story says over one long, crippling hill. This makes the reader think the trip is very hard since he has to ride up so many hills. But if the road wasnt as hilly then the trip would seem less difficult. This would also make it as if that the old guys gave good directions. But the whole point."
