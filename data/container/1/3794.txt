"The features of the setting can affect the cyclist because, say that there was nothing. It might make you want to go faster and left out your inner speed demon. Thats all I can really tell you. Because personally I dont think the setting of where you ride your bike doesnt even matter. Possibly for a bicyclist it can, but to me I dont even think so."
