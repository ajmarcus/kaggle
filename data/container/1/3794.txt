"The features of the setting can affect the cyclist because, say that there was nothing. It might make you want to go faster and left out your inner speed demon. That’s all I can really tell you. Because personally I don’t think the setting of where you ride your bike doesn’t even matter. Possibly for a bicyclist it can, but to me I don’t even think so."
