"The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. First, is the beating sun. The heat dyhydrates and almost kills him. The rocky road is also a factor. It takes up the time and energy he has to preform. Another key ingreedient of the setting was the desert. There was no one to help him and there wasn't a place to get water. In conclusion the setting was a big factor in the story."
