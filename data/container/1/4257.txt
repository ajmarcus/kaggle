"The features of the setting, affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, when it says, The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. The features of this setting are making the cyclist determined. Another example, is when it says, ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake  it really did look like a diamondback blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" The features of the setting are making him brave and couragious. The last example is when it says, I hung my head. The features of this setting are making the cyclist have despair. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist."
