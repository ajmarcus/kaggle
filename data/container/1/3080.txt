"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast the builders of the empire state building had to go through many obstacles to get there job done. I paragraph @NUM1 it states that al smith announces that the empire state building will reach a height of @NUM2 feet, this would be a big obstacle for the builders because they have to risk their lives being that high up just to construct this building. Another obstacle for the workers would be working next to the dirigibles because in the exerpt it state that the dirigible a extreamely flammable so if it touches fire the workers could get seriously hurt."
