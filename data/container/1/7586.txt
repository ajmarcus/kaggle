The author gave a loving mood in the memoir. I know this becacus he did not talk badily about anything and he talked about how his parents helped him and other people as a kit. in paragraph two he was talking about how his house was nice and comsortabur. I know this because he sais. the love of cooking and the passioniate Cuban music.
