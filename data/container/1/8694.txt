"The mood created by the author in the memoir the author's mood feel sad. Because in the cuba, @PERSON1, had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find. In author memoir @CAPS1 will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice."
