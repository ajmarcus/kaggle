I think the author writes this because whatever test she has to take she wasnt ready for before but now whenever the geese return and the hibiscus return the she will be ready to take the test. Maybe she wasnt mentally prepared. So inconclusion I think when she says the geese and the hibiscus return the she will take the test and maybe she wasnt physicaly and mentally prepared for it.
