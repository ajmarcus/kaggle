"From what there is in this  picture the cyclist is riding a dry and area which could mean that it is very hab and the cyclsit looks to be going down hill there looks to be a lot of turns. From the body position of the cyclist he seems to be trying at his best and hardest to make it to his destination. All of this could be a bag stress on the cyclist, he maybe sweating really hard and maybe tired the wind @MONTH1 not be helping him at all."
