The features of the setting afect the cyclist in many ways. If he wasnt in High deserts of California in June he probaly wouldnt be dehydrated if he was in @DATE1 it wouldnt be so hot out. Also if there werent short rolling hills he would have had more energy. As you can see setting affects the cyclist a lot.
