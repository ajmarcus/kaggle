The features of the setting afect the cyclist in many ways. If he wasn’t in “High deserts of California in June” he probaly wouldn’t be dehydrated if he was in @DATE1 it wouldn’t be so hot out. Also if there weren’t “short rolling hills” he would have had more energy. As you can see setting affects the cyclist a lot.
