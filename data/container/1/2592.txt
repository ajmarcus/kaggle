"Dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. They were much better than the balloons. In new York City, there was a lack of suitable landing areas for the dirigibles. Now this would be a good idea for the Empire State Building. Landing on the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or other services. The architects could not just drop a mooring mast on top of the building. The dirigible is thousand-foot long. It would add stress to the building's frame. Engineers soon designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower. The mast had four wings at its corners. The building is now 102 floors. Floors @NUM1 and 102 were for the observation area to double as the boarding area for the dirigible passengers. Workers celebrate framing the entire building after two months. Now people lost their hope. It's because the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was never to fulfill its purpose. It was never safe nor practical. The buiders faces so many obstacles."
