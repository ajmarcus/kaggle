"Saeng thinks that she has failed because she misses her grandmother. The hiscubus plant that she buys reminds her of grandmother’s scent. Saeng spent over @MONEY1 on the hibiscus plant. She needed it to feel a little bit more at home. Saeng feels she had very little time to leave her country, in “a blink.” Her grandmother would want her to be strong and not cry at the thought of being away from her. Saeng needs to think of the good and smile when she is reminded of her past. Saeng wants to pass the test. next time the hibiscus are budding she must not cry."
