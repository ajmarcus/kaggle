"The mood in the memoir, that the author is trying to @CAPS1 you is. That it is calm, and in its own way the mood Kind of leads to forgiveness and @CAPS2. Because the memoir is mostly trying to tell you that no matter where you go you never forget about your family. And that the memories are much better then the reality that you live in. And no matter how far you deciede to go, to a different Country. Never forget who gave you birth. And who loves you. Which really means family. And friends. But the @CAPS3 That they describe in the @CAPS4. He decieds to leave his family to go to america and to get an education. And do something big with his life. And he is going through other things to like, the other People are thinking of him as a immagrant. And how the rest of the family @CAPS5 leave there @CAPS6. But the family to them that really didnt mean anything to them. In there house they left there door open to any family that needs help, or that there going through the same thing as what their family is going through. So thats the mood that the author is trying to describe to you."
