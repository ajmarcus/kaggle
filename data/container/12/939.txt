"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 computers benefit our society has been a hotly debated topic among citizens in our town. Many argue that computers provide quick easy communication, help children and adults learn, and even teach balancing habits to our generation. I firmly believe that computers are necessary in our society. @CAPS2, @CAPS3! I miss you!"" are the words @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM1-year-old @PERSON1. @PERSON1 has been working overseas for two years in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3. One @ORGANIZATION1 the only ways she can contact her father is through @ORGANIZATION3. Communication is extremely important in our society; it brings families and friends closer together. Computers provide a variety @ORGANIZATION1 forms @ORGANIZATION1 communication, such as @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS5, and instant messaging. ""@ORGANIZATION3"" allows people to have what can be called a ""visual phone conversation."" A teary-eyed @PERSON2 says, ""@CAPS4 since @CAPS7 wife died, @CAPS7 daughter has been @CAPS7 only companion. With @ORGANIZATION3, I can not only hear her voice every day but see her face, too. It never fails to make me smile."" @CAPS5 and instant messaging also give out society fast, easy communication with others. Invitations, announcements, and just a quick ""hello"" can all be done by @CAPS5. Therefore, computers are very important for communication in our society. Have you @CAPS4 seen the look on a child's face @CAPS10 he/she learns something new? Computers provide an excellent variety @ORGANIZATION1 education in our society. For example, toddlers and children can use programs such as @ORGANIZATION2 (@CAPS6). @CAPS6 programs teach reading, writing, and speaking to children. ""@CAPS7 child used @CAPS6 @CAPS10 he was a toddler,"" says @PERSON3, a @LOCATION1 resident, ""and now his teachers are so impressed by his reading and writing skills. I couldn't be more proud."" Computers don't only teach children; they teach adults, too! Did you know that adults learn @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 their knowledge about the environment, politics, and other basic information from the computer? Computers are needed to help people learn in our society. Finally, computers teach balance. A @LOCATION1 mom says, ""@CAPS7 teenager @PERSON4 has learned how to balance computer and life, and I can definitely see how it connects to other areas @ORGANIZATION1 balance as well."" @CAPS10 teenagers learn to balance their computer time, they also learn how to balance, extra-curricular activities in school. This shows, as a result, that students actually learn responsibility from computers. I hope that our society will consider the fact that computers are necessary. @CAPS10 they provide commonication, teach education, and help kids learn how to balance, what do we have to lose? Computers can most certainly improve our society."""
