"Dear, @CAPS1 town. As you know it computers are a part of our lives, but is it positive or negitive? Computers can be a great thing it can show you different parts of the world and breaking news, it can deside your next vacation. It could help you talk to famile and friend. What would are lives be without them? Well are lives without computers can be bad. Computers do have negitive sides to like spending lots of maney for one all the times. It needs to be fixed. People can use the computer to much and they want exercise. That can lead to fatness. Also you can waist lots of energy to. A bad part about the internet is chat rooms, if you talk to the wrong people then you can be in trouble. Overall computers are a key part of our and they can help deside with our next @DATE1 breack trip and they can use by making us fat. "
