"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 my name is @PERSON1 and I am writing to you because, I want to inform you about the benefits of having computers. I think that having computers is a great way for kids like me to learn more about things in the world. Having a computer also helps people in need and also inform people about far away places in the the world. I beleive if it wasn't for computers we wouldn't really know that much about our world. Computers also help us to send emergency messages across the world in @NUM1. Some people do not think that computers have an effect onour society but I for one think computers have a very positive effect on people. people also think that computers make people spend less time exercising, but I believe that it actually helps people to exercise because you can go gives different exercising techniques. In conclusion, I think that computers have a positive effect on society."
