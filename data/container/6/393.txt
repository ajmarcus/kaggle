"Dear @CAPS1, I think that people I should they to excersize more than they go on the computer. Computer are one of the main reasons of our nations obessed rate being as big as it is now including junk foods like mcdoanld. I'm a big fan of computers myself don't get me wrong. I would on the computer all night if I could but I don't want my body out. I go to bed at @NUM1 I usally stay on the computer for an hour or two depends if I'm doing a project. Also goign on the computer less could make your life more fun instead of sitting inside go outside and play some sports like football, hang out with your friends have a @CAPS2 with your family. Do something else than be on . Conclesively, if people just puxh them selves to stay on the computer for an @NUM2 hour and a half the obessed! will go down. It could also help save our planet by saving the energy."
