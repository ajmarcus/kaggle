First, people like to go on things such as myspace, secondly people like playing online games. ALstly, some people like to gosep to others online. For example, if you go to soemones house you are always going to see a young kid or a parent online somewhere or playing online gmaes. Also, peopel talk online way too much. First, they go to face book all the time. Secondly, they got ,myspace which you can get your identity stolen. Lastly, kids love to go on myspace it's the smae as myspace. for example, peopel might come to you and say do you have a so and so and sya can I get your eamail address.
