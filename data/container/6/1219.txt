"Computers. First of all. I strongly beleave that people should not use computers all the time. Staying up to late, like on a school day and your tired. Your eyes look at black & white words that can make your tired, forcing to stay up, and drinking red bull monster, or any other energy drink when your not suppose to. Second of all, almost the hole school use's the labtops, and the computers like @PERCENT1 use's them. The othe <@PERCENT2@NUM1> is students and adults write on paper, and that has good hand and combination. the @PERCENT1 is like all people go online, facebook, youtube, games, and google. The @PERCENT2 is all people use to write on their paper, and doodle on the back round. Third of all. In other state's people don't have enternet service, or they can't use computer. People have to write their work on a piece of paper. Some kids, youngadults, adults, and students sometimes have bad hand writing. I think all people should not have a computer."
