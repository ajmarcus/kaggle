"To whomever this @MONTH1 concern, @ORGANIZATION1, almost everyone has them. Computers can make it easier to find certain places by using search engines such as @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 they are also a way of communication. I believe people using computers does benifit society because scientists use computers every day, to make the plans to send a ship into space or to keep progress of an experiment. Computers help people stay organized. A lot of teens and kids use their computers to shop and stay in touch with friends. Some people belive people spend to much time on computers. That @MONTH1 be true, but also remember what its doing for society. When people spend less time exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends its a personal choice. Its not like their being obliged by the @ORGANIZATION1."
