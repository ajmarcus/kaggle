"Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I think people need to see the realatey from computer's and the real world, they're a lot of people spending to much time on the computer and not spending enough time with there familys or doing things that are really important. While your on the computer your not getting any exsercise your not getting stronger your just sitting down. Thats one of the ways people get fat because there not moveing around just sitting down. When your on the computer all day everyday your missing out on whats happening with your family you miss out on every thing that's going on. I think people need to relax on spending time on the computer and get some exsercise or call one of your cousins brothers or even your mon and find out what really up because they are the ones that really matter! But you really can't tell people how long there allowed to spend on the computer you can only give an opinon and hope they listen."
