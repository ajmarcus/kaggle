"Dear local @CAPS1, I think that computers are good for people to have. My first reason is kids might have to write an eassy for school. My second reason is kid might have to look important things up. My third reason is kids might have e-mails. My first reason is kids might have to write an eassy for school. Teachers mostly perfor to have the kids typ their eassys. When kids write eassy's they have to get information on what they are looking. My seocnd reason is kids might have to look important things on. They @MONTH1 have to fill out an alpaction out online when kids get older they want to look up schools they @MONTH1 want to go to. Kids in high school look up collages to get into when they are in like @NUM1 or @NUM2 grade. My third reason is kids migth have e-mails. When kids check their e-mails they are probably trying to see if their parents wrote them. Also some kids don't live near family so they e-mail each other on-line. My first reason is kids might have to write an eassy for school. My second reason is kids might have to look important things up. My third reason is kids might have an e-mail. Now I hope you like the reasons I wrote on why computers are good to have."
