"Dear newspaper editor, I think computer are a benefit to everyone. My first reason why I think computers are abenefit is because if you don't know about somthing and you wana learn more about it, you can just go on the computer and do some research on it. The best part is you can research anything even if its like a million miles away. The internet has imformation on anything and every thing. my second reason why, is because if you have a webcam and some of your relatives live very far away you can see them when ever you want. Its not just webcam either you can also go on facebook and other sites like that to talk to family and friends and see pictures of one another. my last and final reason is that you can do almost anything on a computer. Their software on them to write, do projects, and plan things oct. plus most of the modern day society uses computers for stores and business's to keep track of things. Well thats why I think computers benefit us. I told you why I thought they did and how."
