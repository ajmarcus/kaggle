"The features of the setting in Rough Road:Do Not Exceed the Posted Speed Limitby Joe kurmaskie affects the cyclist in a very negative way.It begins slowly with the ghost town.The narrorator chuckled, checked my water supply and moved on, he wasnt especially worried,but the fact he checked his water suggests that hell need to ration it for a while.The decline continues when he reaches the fock and the ramshackle shed.@CAPS1 the description of the place shows you he did not like it,and he confirms that with the words,this sight was troubling.He wouldnt be replenishing his water here.Any more of this hed be dead,either from dehydration or from pessimism.Eventually he reached the road sign which declared that going over 55 mph was a bad idea.This is ironics,he only going 12 mph to put it in his own words,sometimes life can be so cruel.He quite obviously hates the setting,and its all the fault of the setting."
