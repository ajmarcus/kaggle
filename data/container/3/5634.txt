"The author concludes the story with, “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to show Saeng growing up. As another year passes, Saeng will be more comfortable with her circumstances, and ready to start over fresh, just like all the plants will be blooming and budding. Failing her drivers test, really upset Saeng, so by waiting another year, she will be able to practice more, and become better, so that when she goes back and retests, she will be an even better driver, by having the time to practice, and start over. It’s almost like a new beginning for Saeng, another year has past, and new when her familiar plant budds, and begins to start over, so will she. Since the hibiscus plant is familiar to Saeng, she is better able to relate to it, and as it buds, and start fresh, so will Saeng. In conclusion, this is why the author concluded the story with that phrase."
