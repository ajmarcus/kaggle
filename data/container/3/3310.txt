"Based on the excerpt, there were many obsticles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obsticle is that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This could be a big threat to The nearby pedestrians. Furthermore, an additional obsticle is ""nature itself"". The winds are constantly changing which is dangerous for the dirigibles. One last example of an obsticle is ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This would be dangerous if the dirigible lost control and harmed a pedestrian. These are @CAPS1 some examples In the article of how there were many obsticles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
