"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, by the author @ORGANIZATION1, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building @CAPS1 in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State buildings flat roof. They were going to attach a single cable tether, but it would add stress to the buildings frame. They had to make the frame of the building stronger, which the desinged a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless stell tower that would illuminated from inside. When they tried it the wind was to strong, constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. They also couldnt due it because there was a law that airships flying to low over urban areas."
