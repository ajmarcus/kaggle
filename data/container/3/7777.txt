"The mood which Narciso Rodriguez showed in the memoir was thankful and grateful to his mother and father for their love and sacrifice they went through when he was growing up. He was very thankful for their giving arms to anyone who needed them and for their warm attitudes and teachings of what family really defines. Narciso learned this deffinition from his parents, family is or can be anyone important to you and they do not have to be blood related such as a neighbor with a different culture. He is also very grateful for his parents unselfishness by moving to @LOCATION1 for his education not even putting the thought of work in their head. Narciso's mood is represented in every sentence in this memoir written, he was very lucky to have had such a great childhood and ""family"" which he realizes and will be grateful and thankful for everything anyone ever did to help him grow up to who he is now for the rest of his life."
