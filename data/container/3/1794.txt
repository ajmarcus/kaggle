"The Empire State Building's docking zone was a magnificent and novel idea when it was first concieved but it was too difficult to implement. Al Smith, who spearheaded the operation, was too over anxious to complete it. Since not enough time was devoted to researching the risk's and structure of the dock, the plan to mount it on top the Empire State Building was already a failure.       Before the construction even began, trouble started to brew. The building couldn't withstand the stress of the @DATE1 foot long dirigible. The shock to the building would have transmitted tremendous pressure to the foundation. So the roof would have to be re-done in order for it to be structurally sound. After many months and @NUM1 dollars, the creation of the landing dock could begin.       Life is precious, and the landing dock was too volatile and dangerous to be used. The architects overlooked the fact that most foreign ones were made of hydrogen not helium. Hydrogen is extremely Flammable. In @LOCATION1, the Hindenburg, which was constructed using hydrogen caught aflame and killed hundreds. There was even a law stating that aircraft could not be suspended so close to an urban area. The idea was ostentatious and showy but because it was rushed, precautions were not taken into account. The obstacles that faced the docking station were too much, so finally the plan to erect it was abandoned."
