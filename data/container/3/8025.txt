"In the memoir the author creates many moods with in it. In the text the first mood he created was caring because in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family knowing that they would do the same for us."" This shows caring because they would let anyone that was family and wouldn't care. The next mood he showed is being grateful because in paragraph @NUM2 he says"" I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice"". This is him showing that he is grateful because he says it in the sentence and he also tells the reason why he is grateful to them. These are the moods the memoir created."
