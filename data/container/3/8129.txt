"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez the mood created by the author was powerful. It had made one feel as though you were accualy there. The author had explained in detail his living enviornment of a small house in a community of other immigreants like them selvs who had band to geather in rough times. During the memoir the author tells about his cuban background, ""Passionate Cuban Music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" @CAPS1 also tells about @CAPS1's deffinition of family. the ones in his community that wernt just blood related but the neighbors who looked after each other. The author sets the mood of love for his culture and his family within their community. and how his simple three room apartment has become a home."
