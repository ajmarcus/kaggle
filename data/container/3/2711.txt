"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State building faced the obstacles of the use of hydrogen in dirigibles in which is highly flammable, nature itself, and an existing law in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.It stated in paragraph @NUM1 of the excerpt, most dirigibles outside the united state used hydrogen, which is very flammable. Realizing that this kind of happening above an outrageously populated area such as New York City would be extremely dangerous. To explicate. ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident would have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"".However, the greatest obstale was nature itself. At the top of the building, the winds were constantly shifting. which was certainly not safe. For example, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The builders soon realized that this issue could unfortunately, not be resolved.Lastly, a more apparent obsticle that the builders faced was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for the ships to even approach the area.The obstacles of the use of hydrogen, nature itself, and an existing law, made it impossible for Al Smith's plan to become realistic."
