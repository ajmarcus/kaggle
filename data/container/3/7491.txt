"The author creates many different moods throughout the memoir. In the beginning, the author talks about his traditional Cuban home, in which he feels extremely comfortable and safe. Here, he creates a mood of warmth, and a very family oriented upbringing, all positively. Around paragraph @NUM1, the author begins to talk about his pride in the success and determination of his family. For example, (paragraph @NUM1, final sentence) ""The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them. (his parents) to endure these hard times."" This gives a mood of pride and great triumph. That is the mood that @PERSON1 gives in the memoir from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives."""
