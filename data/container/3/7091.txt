"The author generally stayed in one mood. The mood portrayed in the story was family and friends are very important and they help what you will be in the future. This is why the author stressed how thankful he was that his family had come to @LOCATION1 to make him a better life and that his friends came over to share their culture. Also the author was saying that even in @LOCATION1 it was important to remember his cuban blood and culture. This is why he says ""...and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas, of the kitchen."" Also the author say's that a home is where geat memeries are and were you grow up, you should never forget it."
