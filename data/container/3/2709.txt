"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. The dirigibles weren't safe in a city like New York because of violent wind currents at the top of the building that would make the dirigibles ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Also many blimps from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If there was an accident like the Hindenburg in New York, more than just the passengers would be harmed. Another obstacle was that there was a law forbidding airships to fly too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for ships to even go near the Empire State Building."
