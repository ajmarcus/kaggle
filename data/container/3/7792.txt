"In this memoir, the author, Narciso Rodriguez enstills a kind of loving mood and a strong feeling of gratitude. He is thankful for the fact that his parents sacrificed their happiness and family for the well-being of their child's (Narciso's) life, as shown in paragraph @NUM1, where it says: ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" Also, Narciso gives a feeling of admiration for his parents. He admires their courage for leaving all the wonderful stuff in Cuba, as he says in paragraph @NUM2: ""I've often told them [his parents] of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly.""All in all, Narciso really shows a feeling of love in this memoir."
