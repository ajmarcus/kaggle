"Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were that inside the dirigibles were hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The builders did not want to risk any lives or damage any buildings. They realized how much worse an accident could be if it took place in down town New York.The greatest obstacle was the wind on top of the building. The winds were constantly shifting due to air currents. Also dirigibles would be dangling over pedestrians on the streets below.The last reason is because their was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for them to tie it up to the building or even approach it."
