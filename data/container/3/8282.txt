The mood created by the author in the memoir was ment to be a happy and thankful mood. The mood was created happy because the child Narciso was very hapy that his parents moved to @LOCATION1. He was also happy because his house was not just a house it was a home. The kin Narciso was thankful because his parents let other people into the home untill they have somewhere elese they can call home. He is also thankful that he got his parents marvilous culinary skills so he can cook very well. He is also thankful for his parents love and sacrifice. The mood that we are suppose to get is a happy yet calm mood well we read this because Their is nothing to exciting but their is some parts where you get happy for what they did and you feel calm because as I said their is nothing really jumping out at you.  it is just a life story.
