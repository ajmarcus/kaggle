"The setting plays an important part in the authors mood. When the author finds the dilapidated ghost town, he is still high spirited and amused. He thinks that it is a little funny that the old mens town was now abandoned. (the town) fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled This shows that the author is still in good spirits because he can still laugh. When a tar like substance  oozed out of the water pump at the next stop the author became a little unsettled, as the author was running low on water. But he was still optomistic. Once the rolling expansive hills came into view, the author  let out a sad, hopeless laugh. The author was depressed , dehydrated and had all but given up , however he kept going and eventually made it to some water."
