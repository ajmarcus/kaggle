"The features of the setting have a huge effect on the cyclist. There was a point in the story where he ran out of water ad he remembered that the old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the rode. He was tired ad dehydrated but he thought he could make it along the road. So he started off and the two miles later the terrain changed and so did his outlook on this entire journey. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. ""Sometimes life can be so cruel. @CAPS1 hills took a lot out of him and he was now on a highway. Before this terrain change the rider is very positive and thinks he can do this easily. I could make that! But after the terrain change he looses hope and almost dont make it. It didnt really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean. It is obvious as you read that when the terrain becomes tough it has a huge negative effect on the cycilists."
