"The workers faced many obstacles in the process of building the mooring mast. The first reason was because of the High Winds. The winds blew the dirigibles two-and-frow. It would be cotastrophic if an accident occurred. Secondly, The Law stood in the way of this idea. A law in New York was passed, that prevented dirigibles from flying over urban areas. The reasoning behind the law was because of a german dirigible accident in New Jersey. Lastly, and probably the simpilest, There was no clear way to land! The landing gear had not been invented yet, so it was too risky to even attempt landing. In conclusion, this idea was way ahead of its time, which is both good and bad in most ways."
