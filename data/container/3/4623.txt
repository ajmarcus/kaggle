"In the story, “Do not exceed posted speed limit”, there are many features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, in the beginning of the story it says that, “The sun was beginning to beat down”, the temperature was beginning to rise, but it had not really affected the cyclist because he had plenty of water supply. Next the story says, “I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June”, California’s temperature is really high and June is one of the hottest months of the year. The temperature was very high and the cyclist did not have much water left. This was affecting the cyclist because he was tired, hot, and getting dehydrated. Finally, at the end of the story the terrains were changing and there had been more hills and a road that was not as smooth as pavement because it was a dirt road and the hills were making the cyclist have to cycle harder to go past making him very tired. Also the temperature was still very high and he did not have barely any water left. By the end of the ride the setting of roads, temperature and the distance of the ride had made the cyclist exguasted and dehydrated. "
