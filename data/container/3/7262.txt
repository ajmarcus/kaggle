"In this memoir of the author creates a clear mood. He keeps stating over and over that he is so grateful of his parents and family members. Also, he describes that his house was always filled with amazing smells and cuban music. It also says that there was always a feeling of love and happiness in the air which sometimes pushed them through the hard times that they faced. Another thing that he says is that even though almost everyone has a different race, everyone got along and help others out. And one final way I know he had a happy mood, is that he said everyone was honest and hard working."
