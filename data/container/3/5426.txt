"“When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The story “winter hibiscus” ended with this paragraph because it will be a fresh start for Saeng. It will be spring out and the geese will come back to her home where she lives now, which now has the hibiscus to remind her of her old home. The paragraph also compares Saeng to the hibiscus. In the story her mother says, “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it is strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matters.” Saeng is the winter hibiscus that’s strang enough to make it through winter and failing the test won’t matter until spring when she will take it and pass. That’s represented when the hibiscus is in bloom. I also think the story ended this way because it ties in Saeng’s feelings throughout the story of her new home and old home. It’s also showing her ability to conquer obstacles. She is going to forget about failing the driving test and work to pass it in the spring."
