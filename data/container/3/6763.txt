"I think the author concluded the story with this statement because to me it sounds like its going to be a new start for her-self in the spring. She talks abouts how when the hibiscus starts budding, the snows, is gone and its spring that when shell retake the test. To me it seems like when the hibiscus comes back to life. Its having like a second chance and she desrves one also. When its bright out again and things start looking out again and things starts looking good shell feel good about taking the test over again. How she ended it to me was good. You just have to read into it and try to understand what she is actually saying. So practically shes stating once everything come back to life then shell feel like she will pass it next time. Now she can be prepared."
