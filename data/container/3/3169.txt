"Due to Several factors the Empire State Building faced many obstacles trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One serious obstacle was that the dirigible moored at the top of the build held only by a tether would stress the buildings frame. In paragraph nine it says ""the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the framework.""Another complication was nature itself. Above the city were strong winds which were constantly shifting due to air currents. This made it impossible to dock. As well as nature working against the mooring mast so was the law. In paragraph fifteen it says ""on existing law against airships flying too low over low urban areas."" Which made it illegal for an airship to ever tie up the the Empire State Building."
