"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by author @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A first obstacle the builders faced was the concern of the building collapein over time with ""all the weight of the dirigibles. They would have to spend more money and time to create a frame for the Empire State Building to support the dirigibles."" @CAPS1 @NUM1 supports that obstacle ""a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the buildings frame"". A second obstacle builders of the Empire State Building came upon on attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building was the concerns of the thousands of citizen just below the tall building. After german dirigible was on fire in Jersey they realized how serious they situation can become. ""Owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse it that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" These were two of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced."
