"The mood created by the author in the memoir. The mood was a good feeling. To explaination of how he lived @NUM1 reality. Having family come live with you till they get back on their feet. Having family all around you. Realizing you turned your ""house into a Home"". Endless celebrations that encompassed, both form a a backdrop to life in their warm home. ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in their country they loved."" ""The barriers to work were strong and high and my parents both accepted that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they had deserved."" ""In Cuba, Narciso, Sr.. Had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied Chemical Engineering."" In @LOCATION3, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."" Is what I thought the author in the memoir mood was."
