"The mood Created by the author in the memoir is in my opinion pure happiness and Love. Narciso Rodriguez says that ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sence that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. This family shows this many times in this memoir, they always had people over, like the landloard's daughter Alegria who was Narciso's first friend and babysitter she went over to eat dinner very often. Narciso also States that ""also at the table were sergio and Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would know my ""real"" grandparents, Narciso the Elder and @PERSON2, until 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba)"" @CAPS1 also always has many of his aunts, uncles, and cousins for dinner, and ""countless extended family members came and went"" But @CAPS1 says @CAPS2 ""My parents always kept their door open to the many people we considered family"" which explains why the house was full of happiness but I think the house was full of love because ""I will never forget how my parents turned a simple house into a home."""
