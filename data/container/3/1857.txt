"The obstacles on allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building were far to great, something that should have been obvious before construction started. One major reason, safety. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is very flammable, and after the ""Hindenburg"" accident in Lakehurst, the idea was shot down. Another reason why it just didn't work was the wind current at the top of the Empire State building. Winds would have been to great for dirigibles to safely dock at the Empire State. There was already a law about Airships flying too low over urban areas. With a dirigible approaching the building would make it illegal. Thus ending the idea to proceed."
