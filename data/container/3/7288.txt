"The mood of the excerpt is very bright. The author describes her risk taking, loving parents. The author describes the many things her parents have given to her. ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home... Both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today... Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house.""     As you can see, the author. Narciso Rodriguez, describes her young life and home with happiness and greatfullness. This is all generously spoken within the depths of the excerpt. Many authors enjoy using these tones to express their own personal feelings and opinions about the matter. In this case, the author wanted to express joy in her writing."
