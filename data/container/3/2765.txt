"In the excerp ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire state building faced many problems when constructing the dirigibles dock. One is the winds and the safety of the building and people. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents... using the Empire state building was neither practical nor safe."" Another obstacle that the builders faced was that there was a law that prohibited airships to fly too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegle for the ship to even tie up to the building or even approach the area."" There was also another problem. It was the building's structure and the foundation. The builders made over sixty thousand dollars of modifications to the building structure in order to construct the mast."
