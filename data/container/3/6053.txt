"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows the character, Saeng , was going to adapt to their new home and stay strong. I believe, when Saengs mother says, Its flowers arent as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus, I think Saengs mother is also sort of thinking about Saeng Its almost as if shes saying that the move here scarred Saeng but she will be strong and survive the change likes anyone who has failed a test, she will study more and try hander to pass it next time. Saeng  isnt going to give up and shell keep holding on to make it through Saeng knows its hard to adjust to changes to lifes but with a little courage and hard work, it will be a breeze. If she believes in herself, shell be able to get situated in this new place."
