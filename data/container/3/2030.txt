"There are many reasons Why the builder's faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1 the excerpt states that most dirigibles from outside of the United states use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The hydrogen can cause a fire and destroy the Empire State building and can destroy downtown New York. Another reason why the builder's faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is because it was against the law. In paragraph @NUM2 the exerpt states there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This could be dangerous to the citizens of downtown New York."
