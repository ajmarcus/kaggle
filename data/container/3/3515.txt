"The @CAPS1 of the empire state building had to cross many obstacles in order to have a dirigible dock on the Empire State Building. They needed to build a mooring mast for the dirigible to dock on the Building. This presented another problem however because if dirigible docked on the building its weight would be to much for the building. They overcame this obstacle by rienforcing the building's supports. The largest obstacle and the one that defeated this idea of docking a dirigible on the Empire State Building was simply the elements. The violent air currents and high winds made it impossible for a dirigible to safely tether itself to the top of the empire building. For example when the @ORGANIZATION2 dirigible Los @CAPS2 tried to get in range of the mooring mast but was unable to, do to the fiercely forceful winds. In the end the @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building could not overcome the obstacles."
