"Builders had many promblems with allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. First of all in @CAPS1 @NUM1 the author exsplains that ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would only add stress to the buildings frame"". Builders with that would have to construct the building to make it more stable. Also there were cases that outside the United States they use Hydrogen other then helium. Hydrogen is very flamible, and because new york is so populated it would not be safe to podestrions. Seeing this you can tell that builders had to many promblems coming from such an ""easy"" thing."
