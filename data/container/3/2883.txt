"The builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 thought that they had a great idea and that they were pioneers. They soon realized that there were some problems with their ideas. One major problem was safety. As noted in paragraph @NUM1, most @LOCATION3 dirigibles used hydrogen, which was highly flammable. New York is one of the biggest cities in the United States, and it was far too densely populated to take that risk. Another problem was wind. At those heights, the wind currents were unpredictable and winds reached high speed. If the dirigible were to be blown around while in the downtown area and were to hit a spire of the building, there would certainly be quite a few casualties. After the risks and rewards were balanced, they realized it just wasn't worth it."
