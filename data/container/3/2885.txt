"One problem that the builders has was that they had to make the mast big enough. Some dirigibles would be @NUM1 feet long. If the just dropped a mast on top of the Empire State Building becaus the stress of a thousand-foot dirigible held to the Empire State Building by just one cable tether, there would be a lot of stress put on the building's frame. If they did the weight of the dirigible and the wind all of that stress and pressure would be put on the buildings foundation that was nearly eleven hundred feet below which was not safe at all. They had to go through all of the different possibilities and they also had to make sure that it was going to be safe. While designing the mast they had to consider the winds at the top of the building, the winds were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. If they did design a good mast the dirigible would be dangling above pedestrians, which was not safe."
