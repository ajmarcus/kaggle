"In the excerpt, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Narciso Rodriguez's Home: The @CAPS1 print of our Lives, the author creates a very warm, kind of theme by painting a picture in the reader's mind of a family long ago, that lived in unity and supported each other, pulling through in the very end. The author mentions several things from which one can infer the sensation of a strong supportive family that has everything it needs. As the author tells us, ""In 1961 @NUM1  family, blond  brick building created our traditional Cuban home very heart kitchen rich culinary skills and a love of cooking Passionate cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen innocence of childhood, congregation of family and friends endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" ( @NUM1). This quote comes across with not just @CAPS2 meaning, but with a feeling that's hard to obtain  like when you're sitting around a campfire with friends and/or family. This feeling is created by the author's language, displaying a masterpiece to the reader. Language like ""very heart"" and ""warm house"" is what really conveys it. In conclusion, the author uses language appealing to a readers sense of safety, warmth, and unity to create a warm theme in his memoir."
