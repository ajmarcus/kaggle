"The mood created in this memoir is comfort. To me it is so comforting because it is such a happy memoir, where these two young people invite other people over their house all the time. They also let people stay until they are able to get back on their feet. There is not one ounce of sadness to me, just a happy and inviting family which comforts me. Another thing is the lifestyle. I love how they are proud of their Cuban heritage. They listen to their Cuban music and always cook their Cuban food. I love it when people are not afraid to be themselves. It comforts me knowing everyone is happy. That is why the mood created in this memoir to me is comfort."
