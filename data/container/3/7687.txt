"The mood created by the author, @PERSON1, in the memoir was grateful and it had gratitude. In paragraph @NUM1 he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" His parents sacrificed their families, friends, careers, and the country they love to selflessly come to @LOCATION1 to give their son a better child hood because they loved him that much. Even though they had to change jobs and take any possible work. They also struggled with finances, harsh northern winters, and cultural hardship that wouldn't give up and that's why the author was grateful, creating the mood. "
