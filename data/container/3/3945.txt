"The story Rough Road ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie was about a man traveling through some pretty difficult settings. The cyclist’s mood was detirmined by the setting as well as his needs and his detirmination to make it. The setting of the story early summer in California. The weather is described as hot as, ""The sun [began] to beat down."" He, ""was traveling through the high deserts of @CAPS1 can June."" Because of the excessive heat, he needed more water, which shortly became the conflict of this story. As things got more difficult his attitude towards the old men’s advice changed from gracious for their help to wishing he had never listened to them. Also as the difficulty increased his detirmination to move on also increased by, ""telling [himself] if [he] could make it that far, [he’d] be fine."" @CAPS2 for the cyclist, the settings affect was negitive.
