"When cycling or doing any outdoor sport, the setting matters greatly. If its cold you need a jacket. Hot you need water. Depending on how secure it could be life or death. It could be realy hilly and you might get tired, and if you have no water you could die. Also it depends if its in a city burbed, small town, desert, highway all these factors play a huge roll in cycling"
