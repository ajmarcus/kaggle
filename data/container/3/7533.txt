"The mood that Narciso Rodriguez created was a very happy and uplifting mood. It makes you feel like you were there and that you wish your family could be like that. You wish and hope that you could have a life like that where everyone will do anything for you and everyone is so close and they have dinner every night together. He makes it seem like not having any money is the best way to live. That even though you left your family, friends, jobs everything is okay because you are with each other. You are with your family but they are not your blood family. They are having so much fun with people you just met because they are so excited that they made it to @LOCATION1 and they are just having fun with their culture and tradition. The whole neighborhood is one big family they all call the older people who are living in their basement their grandparents when their real grandparents are in Cuba. It just makes you think about your family and all they do for you."
