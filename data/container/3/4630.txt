"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist was on a very long bike ride to Yosemite National Park. However, on the way there, he had to cross through a desert like terrain. The blistering sun had been beating on his back for many miles. All the heat built up a desire for him to get water. He had been very tired. The terrain had made him drenched in sweat. If it wasn’t so hot, then he wouldn’t of had that much of a hard time. The desert contains a very high temperature, which makes it harder to endure physical activities. Even if you are to have a high endurance. The heat will make you very tired, and you will lose a lot of energy. Also, it didn’t help anything, that the elderly men, had gave him terrible directions. That is why I think the setting affected the cyclist."
