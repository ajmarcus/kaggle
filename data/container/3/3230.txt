"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Since the German dirigible the Hindenburg was destroyed in New Jersey it would have been more dangerous over a densey populated area like New York where the Empire State building was. the greatest obstacle to the success of the use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were shifting due to air currents. Dirigibles would not be safe dangling high above pedestrians on the street. The major problem architect faced was that dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building because it has a law against airships flying to low over urban areas. Even though it seemed like a good idea at the time, it was not practical or safe."
