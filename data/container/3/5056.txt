"The features of the setting really affected the cyclist. The author wrote of rough terrain and isolation. Flat roads was replaced by short, rolling hills tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. After reading this information and the descriptions. I inferred that the author was alone in the desert with awful conditions. I go inferal a tone of resentment also. He seemed to wish he hadnt taken the shortcut that landed him in the desert. The hot weather was another factor that affected the author, trying to keep my balance in a dehydrated state. He seems to have not really planned how long the ride would be and how to conserve water. The rough terrain desolation and hot temperatures seemed to have affected the cyclist / author."
