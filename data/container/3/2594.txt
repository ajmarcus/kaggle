"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. Safety was a huge issue. Foreign derigibles often used hydrogen gas to stay aloft, which is highly flammable. A fire posed a dangerous threat in such a densely populated area as New York City. Another great obstacle was the turbulent wind at the elevation of the mooring mast, which would have prevented the dirigible from staying in one place. This would make it extremely difficult for passengers to safely board or exit the zeppelin. One way to solve this problem would be to weigh down the blimp with lead weights, but this was also a dangerous practice, because the weights could fall to the ground and crush those passing by. Although a mooring mast was in theory, a useful idea, it was neither safe nor practical."
