"The mood created by the author in the memoir is proud. The author was proud because he was growing up as a loving caring child in the US. Also he was proud that even though his family moved to th US from Cuba he still practices his Cuban culture. Another reason that he was proud is that he has loving parents that want him to be successful in life. His parents helped him keep up with is culture by having family come over."" My @CAPS1 Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary… regularly joined us at our table."" (ph @NUM1) This quote shows that Narciso Rodriguez family came to join his parents and him for dinner. Narciso family gave up everything including leaving Cuba so he can have a better life. A life that his family can be proud of."
