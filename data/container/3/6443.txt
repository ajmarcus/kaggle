"In the “passage winter Hibiscus” by monfong Ho, the quote “ when they come back, Saeng vowed silently, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again, it symbolizes @CAPS1 new journey in the new country she lives in. In the test Saeng is having a personal discrepancy, missing her homeland @CAPS2 she states “I – failed the test.” This test meant more to then she just failing. She was a test to her ability to function in her new country and she failed. The “ when they came back…” quote started above can be analyzed deeply as the snow being her obstacles and the hibiscus being herself. When the obstacles melt away and she buds into a new stronger person she will take the test again."
