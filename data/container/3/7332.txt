"There was a mood created by the author in @CAPS1 memoir. Here are some points to help support this parenthesis identify a new mood, his gratefulness, and his view on things. First, parenthesis identify a new mood. When it goes from sentence to parenthesis the new mood appears then it goes back. Here is my reason why the story, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with aromas of the kitchen."" @CAPS2, his gratefulness. @CAPS1 is very grateful for how things turned out. Here another reason why from the story. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS3, his view on things. @CAPS1 had very fortunate times in his eyes. Ultamately these were my reasons for the mood that was created by the author parenthesis, gratefulness, and his perspective."
