"In this memoir about Narciso Rodriguez the ton is happy and loving. In this memoir there are many examples about how the tone is loving, and happy, but heres a few. First in paragraph @NUM1 there + two phrases in parenthesees that show how @CAPS1 loved the things like the music and the cooking of his home, and family. ""(and for which I am eternally greatful)."" And, ""(which I adore to this day)."" @CAPS1 wouldn't have added the use things in unless @CAPS1 truly meant it, and if @CAPS1 really loved his home. Also what sets the tone is how @CAPS1 talks about loving his parents, and how @CAPS1 is grateful for them. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" @CAPS1 states in the first sentence of paragraph @NUM2. Lastly, the last sentence of the memoir is happy and puts a smile on your face after you read it, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" In Rodriguez's memoir, it has a happy and loving tone throughout it."
