"There were many obsticles in the process of building the process to build a mooring mast. The designers had to think they're way around them.It was easily known you couldn't just go up to the top and start construction. There were acomidations to be made. The exerpt describes, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation..."" (@CAPS1). Just adding it on would upset the buildings structure and foundation.Safety was a concern. People realized it was a bad idea to have something as highly flammable as the dirigible. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium..."" (@CAPS1). After recent fires, it was noticed now dangerous this idea was.Control was an issue in the city; rather than an open feild. ""... the back of the ship would swivle around the mooring mast"" (@CAPS1). That wasn't going to'fly' with most people, It would be almost imposible to keep it @CAPS4 for people loading. Designers face a lot of problems in constructing buildings but in this case, the mooring mast just wasn't ment to be."
