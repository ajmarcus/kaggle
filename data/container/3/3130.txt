"Acording to the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced obsticles in attempting to attache a dirigible mooring unit to the top of the building. In paragraph @NUM1, @CAPS1 says ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" and Then describes how harsh winds could render the mast unstable. Another obsticle in the making of the mast was a law stating derigibles could not fly under a certain altitude, The set altitude was higher then the building was tall. The last obsticle was safety, in paragraph @NUM2 @CAPS1 talks about how some blimps are filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The effect of a blimp fire over a vastly populated area would be devistating. The mooring mast on the Empire State building was an ingeniose idea, but had to many obsticles to make it work."
