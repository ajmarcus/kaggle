"Many obstacles presented themselves while builders attempted to build a landing dock for dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. The obstacles included the publics safety, @CAPS1 that were already put in place, and the unpredictable weather.Many dirigibles use hydrogen gas which is very flammable. After the German Hindenburg went down it became apparent that the publics safety would be in danger from the vessels bursting into flame over crowded streets. At the time there were also @CAPS1 forbidding aircrafts from traveling too low over urban areas and the landing dock was too low. The final problem was the unpredictable weather. Piolets were worried the strong winds would blow the tethered vessel into another building or into sharp spires that would ruin the vessel and put the people below in danger. Many obstacles hindered the loading dock on the Empire State Building."
