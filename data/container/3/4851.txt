"The features affect the cyclist.The setting affects the cyclist because its real hot. So he takes a couple tips on some short cuts by some old men. Then come to find out these tips werent really short cuts. So now hes riding and angry that he took their tips. Also hes running out of water and becoming dehydrated. He sees an abonded place with water, but in order to get it you need to pump it. So he starts pumping and sees black gunk. He pumps for about @NUM1 to cool the water, but it doesnt cool off. Come to find out the water tastes like battery acid. So he starts riding again. but encounters a snake. Luckily he gets away, but he feels that hes about to die and regrets listening to men who havent got off their porch since @PERSON1 was president. What makes him more angry is that they seemed so sure. As as he's riding he sees a juice factory and goes there. Now its a fishing store and drinks lots and lots of water. He also says hes never listening to old men and hell always use the map."
