The author concludes the story that way so she can keep everyone wondering. I belive she ended that way to let us know that she will be back and when she comes back she will be ready for everything including that test. She left us wondering because when she does come back she is going to want use to Read about what happened when she came back and what happened when she @CAPS1 the test. She only made that vowe to herself nobody else because if she did she would have let them down if she failed. That is why she concludes the story that way.
