"One of the original purposes of the Empire State Building was to be a loading dock for dirigibles or blimps. This was meant to help New York be a leader in modern traveling. Yet there were many obstacles that eventually put an end to the idea of a mooring mast. A major problem was nature itself. The wind on top of the building was constantly changing because of the air currents. This would cause the dirigible to swing around the mast. The idea of weighting the back was immediately ruled out because of the danger imposed on the pedestrians on the street. Also there was a law that stated airships could not fly too low over urban areas, which would make it illegal for and dirigible to tie up or even approach the area."
