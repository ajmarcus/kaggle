"In this excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", @ORGANIZATION2 describes the architectural, chemical, and legal challenges that prevented the construction of a mooring dock for dirigibles on the top of the Empire State Building. Despite the readiness of then- @CAPS1 Al Smith, who publicly announced the plan, and of John Tauranac, who reported that the top of the Empire State Building ""would serve a higher calling [than] to add a desired few feet,"" @ORGANIZATION2 contends that the failure of the mast ""should have been apparent before it was ever constructed"".According to the article, the mast, and a moored dirigible, ""would add stress to the building's frame."" More than sixty thousand dollars was spent to accommodate the pressure. Foreign dirigibles also contained hydrogen, which was more flammable than American-used helium. An explosion above the Empire State Building would be devastating to the city. An existing law prevented dirigibles from ""even approach[ing]"" the building. @ORGANIZATION2 uses these reasons to detail the unrealistic nature of the mooring mast."
