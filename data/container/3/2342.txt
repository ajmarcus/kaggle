"On the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" written by @ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was very difficult, in my understanding it wasn't successful.Architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts of the @PERSON1 air station, the navy leader offered it's dirigible to be used in testing the mast. And in figuring out if it's okay for the mast to be used architects couldn't simply drop a mooring mast because it would cause stress to the building's frame. Also the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose. It wasn't safe enough and because those dirigible that come from outside the @LOCATION2 don't always use helium they use hydrogen which is highly flammable which is a bad idea to have in the @CAPS1 of downtown New York."
