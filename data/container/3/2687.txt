"The obstacles the builder of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, was noticing that the dirigibles would be unsafly dangling high above pedestrians on the Street. There were many risk when landing the huge dirigibles and also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to even approach the area. Famous and important dirigibles had lots of trouble with their landing like for example on December 1930, the U.S Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mask but could not get close enough because of forceful winds. The dirigible could move uncontrolably and crash into the Sharp Spires on other buildings around it. In @CAPS1 of becoming the of transportation of the future, dirigibles had given way to airplanes."
