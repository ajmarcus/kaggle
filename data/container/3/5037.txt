"'Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrian changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills'' (Kurmaskie @NUM1). When the cyclist realized the terrain was becoming difficulty he become more ignorant and hopeless. ''Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt; and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades caused me to laugh. it was a sad, hopeless laugh'' (@NUM1). He wasn't goig to die, die but even though he was struggling, he made a big deal out of it. Unfortunately, the man lived. He would live on, telling people not to listen to old men. ''Never accept travel advice from a collection of old timerd who haven't left the confines of their porches since carter was in office'' (@NUM3). He was on a long, hot raod, and he started taking stabs at the old men ''I made a mental note to change that paragraph'' (@NUM4) The man was not forced to take direction from the old man. In his selfishness to cut back thos trip of only a few rough terrain, heat, and dehydration caused him to be hopeless,angry, and he felt sorry for himself."
