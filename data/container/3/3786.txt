"The features of the setting affect of the cyclist because the setting changed so drastically. The flat wide open road turned into to short, rolling hills. Because he was already running out of water it was making harder for him to have the will power and determination to go up and down these hills. His determination started to fade because he started to see wide open lands with nothing but tumbleweeds and ridiculously large snakes. He felt like he was going to dehydrate because the sun was beating down and had no water left. He used pebbles that he had found to put in his mouth to help circulate the saliva he had in his mouth. He wishes that he would choke on one because he feels so useless. "
