In Joe Kurmaskie’s “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1” the imagery is what sets the cyclist back. The scorching dessert and plant life gives him a sense of seclusion and scares him. Because the cyclist is in the  dessert he keeps on worrying about his water and heatstroke where as if he where in a rain forest he wouldn’t worry about water or heat. I think he siked himself out just by taking in his sorroundings. If the cyclist would have pictured water all around him and arctic like temperatures I think he wouldn’t have been so worried. What’s interesting about this story is that if he would have gotten himself prepared mentally for the conditions he wouldn’t have struggled so much at the end. “At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamond back blocking the majority the pavement in front of me.”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). If the cyclist word of concentrated more on the task at hand and less on what was going on around him I think he would of succeeded without as much stress.
