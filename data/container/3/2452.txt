"The architects who built the mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building had many problems with actually docking any dirigibles there. When they @CAPS1 building the idea of being able to dock blimps on the top of a building was revolutionary and ideal. But they had many issues with safety, weather and laws. One issue with safety was that the gas inside the dirigibles, hydrogen, is highly flammable. One accident could harm hundreds of people in New York's streets. The wind on top of the building was also very strong. Making it difficult for any blimp to get in close enough. the last difficulty  that the builders had was laws. There were certain laws not allowing air ships to fly too low over high populated urban areas. While their mooring mast seemed like a good idea to start out with, sadly it never got much use."
