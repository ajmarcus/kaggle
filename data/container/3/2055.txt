"In the 1930's the world was evolveing and new technology's were comeing of age. One of these tecnology's was the Dirigible and some people thougt to expand it's use. One of these idea's was the moring mast on the Empire State building. This was a great idea but the things that stood in it's way made it impossible. A major problem was the safty, consdiring it was 1,250 feet up. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If this thing caught on fire, everyone inside would burn to death or crass into the ground and kill everyone under it. Another huge problem was the winds and ease of pushing it off corse. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These winds made it simply impossible for this to happen. One problem that should have bee looked at from the beging was law. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building was an existing law against airship's flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS1 this moring Mast was a fantastic idea, there were to many things standing in it's way."
