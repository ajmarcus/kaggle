"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The author stated, ""The greatest reason was one of safety."" Dirigibles used hydrogen more often than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If a dirigible were to catch fire or crash, it would be very dangerous over a populated area.Another obstacle was nature. The author wrote, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The wind would be too much for a dirigible to handle.A final reason stating why they couldnt dock was because it was against the law. The story stated, ""... was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law made it illegal to dock.The dirigibles faced many obstacles that didnt allow them to dock at the Empire State Building."
