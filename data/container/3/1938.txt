"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the frame of the building. In @LOCATION1 @NUM1, it explains that attaching a durgible to the building would add stress to the building's frame. They had to modify the whole frame of the building to a stronger material for the mooring mast to work. One of the biggest obstacles was safety. Most durgibles use hydrogen to power them, and hydrogen is highly flammable. There is a great risk of the dirigibles to catch on fire when flying over such a densely populated area as New York. Another obstacle in the way of the mooring mast was the conditions at the top of the building. At the top of the Empire State Building, there are violent winds that would cause the dirigibles to swivel around the mooring mast. Lastly, An obstacle the builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. As explained in @LOCATION1, because of this law, it is illegal to even fly up to the Empire State building. With all of these obstacles, it is clear why the mooring mast wasn't used."
