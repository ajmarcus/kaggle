"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles was that it was unsafe. It was unsafe because the dirigibles use more hydrogen than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable. In the excerpt it says the greatest obstacle was nature itself. This is because the winds at the top of the building was constantly shifting and the back of the airship would swivel around. Another obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over the urban areas. These are the obstacles that the builders of the empire state building had faced."
