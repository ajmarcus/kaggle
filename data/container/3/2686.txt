"The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose for reasons such as, safety, nature, and the laws. The greatest reason was safety because most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable. The German dirigible, Hindenburg, was destroyed by Fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937. This accident could have been much worse if it happened in a densely populated area like downtown New York. Nature was the biggest obsticle to get around because of the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This would cause the back of the ship to swivel around. This is not good because it would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street. Finally, there are laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. That law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. In conclusion, because of these three major reasons, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose."
