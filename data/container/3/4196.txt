"Many of the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist is biking through deserts. A rediculously large snake this quote shows that only is weather and climate agasint him but also nature. I could drop from heat stroke another great quote showing how hot it really is where the cyclist is. There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. A great detailed desciption of where the cyclist is and how deserted the area is. The bottle only contained a few  tantilising sips. This cyclist is low on water in the desert and in the desert with no water that could be a very bad thing. The above quotes really draw you in and you get to see the many features of the setting and what its like for the cyclist."
