"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there and those obstacles include: the lack of a suitable landing area in @LOCATION1, a mooring mast was needed to the top of the building so dirigibles or blimps could anchor there for several hours for fuel, services, and to let passengers on and off, The steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened because a thousand-foot blimp mooring at the top of the building held by a cable tether would cause stress to the building frame. The blimps load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all through the buildings foundation which was somewhere about eleven hundred feet below. The last obstacle in the allowing blimps to dock at the Empire State Building was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas which would make it illegal for a dirigible to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."
