"In the excerp ""The Mooring Mast"", by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to come up with a safe plan which included building designs and figure out problems they failed to see from the begginning.The first obstacle was meeting with the navy and other experts to come up with a safe and practical plan. They had to find a way to land the dirigibles without adding stress to the buildings frame and without spending @MONEY1 to strengthen it. The builders came up with a plan that included what the mast would have to be made of and what wold be on each floor. They even had to finish the roor before the mooring mast cold take place.The largest obstacle was one they failed to see from the beginning. In building the mooring mast, they would have to face obstacles that nature brought, which was simply impossible. Safety was the main problem. if a fire occurred, there would be a disaster. The winds were too strong due to violent air currents and there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low. After all this work, they couldn't get passed the obstacles, and the mooring mast was never built."
