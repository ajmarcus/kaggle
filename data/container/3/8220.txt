"In this memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The @CAPS1 prints of Our Lives the mood was very happy and made me thankful. My grandparents moved to the @CAPS2.S when my mom was just six. They wanted to give her and her brothers and sisters a better life. This is why I am thankful. I live in the @LOCATION1. The mood is also happy because everyone loved eachother. They didnt have the nicest home, but it was full of love. The music was always playing and Family came a lot. The door was always open in the Rodriguez house. The last sentence in this memoir ""I will never Forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This made me smile it was so beautiful. This is how the mood was happy and made me thankful. The next time I see my grand parents I will make shure to thank them for moving to the @CAPS2.S and giving are Family a better life."
