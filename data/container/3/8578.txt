"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is said in all different ways. In paragraph @NUM1 when she talks about her love for cooking the mood is calm with a dash of spice to it. Since she is Cuban I like to think the cooking is spicy. In paragraph @NUM2 she states, ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open to many people we considered family..."" That is a happy loving mood. To be able to say that means you have some pretty amazing neighbors. In paragraph @NUM3, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" That is the most important mood set in this memoir because she is thanking her parents for her life that she has. That is a very respectful thing to do. Everyone does it, but did you write a memoir about it?"
