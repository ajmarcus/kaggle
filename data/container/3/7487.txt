"The mood in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by @PERSON1 is very cozy and welcomeing. Inside the @PERSON1 home the @CAPS1 describes a cozy and friendly atmospher. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed bot, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"". This quote shows how cozy or ""warm"" their home is. In the memoir he also explains how welcome people are and that everyone in the Apartment building was friends or even family! ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me the great sence that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This quote means that in his welcomeing home friends were also concidered his family. Narciso Rodriguez had a wonderful @CAPS2 to grow up in."
