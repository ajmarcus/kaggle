"The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many problems when attempting to make a mooring mast for Dirigibles. The frist major problem they came across was the biulding its self. It said ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the biuldings foundation."" The biulding being the tallest in the world could not take the pressure. They could possible made it strong but at high cost to something so @CAPS1 already. The architects next obstienle was saftey expessally in a highly populated area such as down town New York. They found the Dirigibles to be to dangerous and uncontroble in a city of towers. The normal processes of docking a Dirigible would have to complete change to acumulate. the mooring mast, soon laws were given to have airships stay away from areas of popurtion after the Hindenburg insodent. Yet some still dared to try and dock at the mast such as the Los Angeles and Columbia but the mast was never put to good use and shows the Problems with inovating things already @CAPS1 as the Empire State building."
