"Narciso Rodriguez by Narciso Rodriguez is a memoir from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives and it is about Narciso Rodriguez's early life. The major mood in the memoir is honesty and truthfulness. This is because the author talks about that you don't want to hear or that makes you sad to hear. For example, the author tells us about racism and how it was normal in the United States but the community overcame it: ""a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close Ð knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need"" (@NUM1). In conclusion, the mood of the memoir is honesty and truthfulness because the author tells us about things that might make us uncomfortable."
