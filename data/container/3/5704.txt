"Mingfong Ho concludes Winter Hibiscus with the paragraph,when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This ending paragraph shows that Saeng will not give up in her struggle to adapt in this new place. Saeng has been going throug hard times; moving to the United States and failing her drivers test. In the greenhouse Saeng even breaks down and crys. The hibiscus flower that saeng bought cost the family a lot of money, but to Saeng it was very important. This flower represented hope. When the flower buds again it would be the right time to take her drivers test. The flower also represents adapting to a new place. As Saeng  adapts to the United States, the hibiscus adapts to the new garden. "
