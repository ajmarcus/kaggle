"In attempting to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building, many problems were faced. One problem faced was in paragraph nine where it says, ""A thousand foot dirigible at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" If the did build the dirigible dock, the would have to reinforce the whole building so it would not collapse. Another problem faced was, most dirigibles used hydrogen, not helium. Therefore since hydrogen is Flammable they could not take the risk of a dirigible blowing up over a heavily populated area. A more ******* problem was the weather, specifically the wind, at @NUM1 feet. The air currents were so violent, that the dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast. Dirigibles usually land in an open field where they could be anchored by lead. According to the excerpt, dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. Lastly, the most major problem was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In paragraph @NUM2, the law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Even through the dirigible dock was a great idea, too many problems were in conflict with the mooring mast for it to go in full effect. On the brighter side, it made the Empire State building the tallest in the world."
