"The builder's main problem with safety. Most Blimps that aren't made in @LOCATION1 are filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If a disaster like the Hindenburg accident happened while the blimp was moving to the tethers at the Empire State building, the outcome would have been much more disasterous. Another Obstacle is the winds. According to the exerpt ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" One final obstacle was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" The builders faced many obstacles by attempting to allow blimps to dock at the Empire State Building."
