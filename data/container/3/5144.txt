"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways. first of these is the blazing heat. He is basically in a desert and he is running low on water. As he starts to run out of water he starts conserving it which is dehydrating him so he is becoming weaker, I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so- a test of my inner spirit. Next up is the rough terrain. When you hit rough terrain on a bike it can get hard to keep going and the cyclist was already short on water a large highway sign jumped out at me. I read: rough road ahad: Do not exceed posted speed limit sometimes life can be so cruel. Finally is the structure First there was the Ghost town with the battery acid tasting water. Also there was the Welchs grape Juice factory and bottling plant which were both probably dimeriling. A sandblusted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head. As you can see the features of the settings generily affected the cyclist."
