"The @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1 many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was the law. There was a law in place preventing airships flying too low over urban cities. This made it illegal for airships to tie up to the building or even come close to the area. Another isue they had was that dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, not helium Hydrogen is extremely flammable and it would be catastrophic if a dirigible blew up over New York City. The last problem they @ORGANIZATION1 was the wind. At the top of the building the winds shifted due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tied up the back end would move around. They got the idea to use lead weights on the back but it would not be safe over all those people."
