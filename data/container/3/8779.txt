"The mood created by @PERSON1, the author of the memoir, Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, is a comforting one. This is shown, for instance, by his reccolection of his childhood in his family's home being fond. For example, he states that he is ""eternally grateful"" for his parents passing on, ""their rich culinary skills and love of cooking"" that he claims to still have. Also, he remembers life as being neighborly and treating neighbors and friends as part of their family with kindness and sharing. This is shown when Narciso says, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" In addition the comforting feeling is shown when Narciso says, ""I learned here about how to love.... My parents turned this simple house into a home. This shows that Narciso had a great place to grown up in and has fond and comforting memories of it."
