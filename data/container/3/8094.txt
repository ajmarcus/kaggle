"Narciso Rodriguez creates a very calm and grateful mood from beginning to end in his memior. First of all, he describes the selflessness of his parents. Narciso explains that ""they had to start their lives over entirely."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) when they left Cuba for the United States. He understands that they only left for his benefit, and he appreciates that. Also, Narciso is thankful that although his parents moved to the United States, they kept their Cuban traditions. In Narciso's three room apartment, ""Passionate Cuban music... filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). Lastly, Narciso expresses his appreciation, and strengthens the mood by defining what a home is. He claims that he ""will never forget how [his] parents turned the simple house into a home"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). For these, Narciso is grateful for, and his appreciation creates a calm, inviting, and grateful mood."
