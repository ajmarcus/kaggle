"In the excerpt ""THE MOORING MAST"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted there were many obstacles that the workers had to face to allow Dirigibles to dock at the top of the empire state building. One of the many obstacles the workers faced was that they could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building. Also the thousand-foot dirigibles moored at the top of the Empire State building. A single cable tether held the dirigible and it would add stress to the building's frame. The biggest obstacle the workers would face was the mooring mast on top of the building with all winds shifting due to vilent air currents. Another obstacle was the dirigibles were moored in open field and they were weighted down in the back. The problem was they were dangling high above pedestrians on the street. Those are the obstacles the workers faced"
