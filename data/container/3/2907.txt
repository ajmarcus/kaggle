"Based on the excerpt, there were a few obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One reason was that ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The owners of the Empire State building realized that if a dirigible was destroyed by fire over a density populated area like New York, there could have been a huge acadent One of the greatest obstacles however was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" When the dirigibles would try to dock, they sometimes could not even get close to the building because of the strong winds By having the dirigibles hanging over pedestrians on the streets of New York, it was considered unpractical and unsafe. Due to mother nature and safety reasons, the builders of the Empire State building faced a few problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there"
