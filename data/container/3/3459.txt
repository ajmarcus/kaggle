"There were many obsticles the builders faced when attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building. First off, there was a great safety concern. Many dirigibles from foriegn countries used helium instead of hydrogen; while helium is very flamlable, therefore the dirigible might explode. Second, the wind made it very challenging to dock the dirigibles. The winds were always changing because the violent air currents. Finally, there was already a law in place against airships flying to low over urban areas. So even if they fixed the other problems it would still be illegal to dock the dirigibles. Those are some problems the builders faced when attempting to dock dirigibles."
