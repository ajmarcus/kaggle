"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives, by Narciso Rodriguez the author creates a calm and loving mood. The author first shows a loving mood when he says ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture... to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. This shows a loving mood because the parents wanted to give their children a better life by moving to american, even though they were leaving alot behind. The author shows a calm mood when he says ""always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"""". This quote puts a calm mood because when you think of filling the air with scents and playing nice music it puts you in a clam relaxed mood. This quote also shows a loving mood as well. This is because it explains her love for her family and that @CAPS1 is proud to call her family a family. All in all the above evidents set the memoirs mood as loving and careing."
