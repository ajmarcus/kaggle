"In the memoir, the author creates a loving, caring and friendly mood. He creates this mood by describing the atmosphere of his home. ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" The setting of their warm, welcoming home contribute greatly to the mood of the memoir. The author's greatfulness to his parents selflessness and courage also contributes. ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" His greatfulness creates a thankful mood through paragraph six and seven, ""it was here were I learned the true definition of ""family"""". This quote helps bring out the love in the mood. The warm, loving mood of the memoir really helps the authors point get across in a meaningful way."
