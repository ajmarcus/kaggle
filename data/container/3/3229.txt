"There were many obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one of the obstacles that had to be faced was dealing with the hydrogen from dirigibles outside of the united states. The hydrogen was very flamable and the would not be able to stand a fire in such a high populated area. Another obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were teathered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. The winds from nature would make it hard to control the dirigible so people were afraid of the dirigible crashing into the building. Those were some of the obstacles that were faced."
