"In building the empire state building, the builders faced many obstacles in the process of letting dirigibles moor at the mooring mast. In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the author gives us examples as to what was difficult. One obstacle in the docking of dirigibles to the mast was safety for the people inside. The article says, ""The greatest reason was one of safety."" It then goes on to say ""Most dirigibles from out of the U.S used Hydrogen, Hydrogen is highly flammable."" another reason was nature. The author states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would lead to unscure departure of passengers. The article also says ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel"" which shows unsafe air conditions. These are two obstacles that made landing at the mooring mast very difficult and soon made it impossible. "
