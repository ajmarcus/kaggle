"In the story Narciso Rodriguez a certain mood is created. For example, one mood is love. @CAPS1 family did everything for love. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This quote shows @CAPS1 family took care of everyone even thought they did not have much themselves.Another example of mood is being together Narciso's family helped out all imagrants to get back on their feet. Paragraph @NUM2 says, ""they came selflessly, as many imagrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" Narciso's family helped the less fortunate very often. The mood of this story is very inviting and peaceful."
