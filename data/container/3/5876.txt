"In the short story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, a young girl named saeng recalls her life before she moved to @LOCATION1 .She misses her homeland and all of the things she loved before she came here. Towards the end of the story, the author includes a paragraph saying that saeng vowed to take her drivers test again when winter ends, when the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding. The author concludes the story with this paragraph for one reason. He/She wants to show that saeng is strong enough to survive the winter, just like the hibiscus, and will be ready when the weary days of winter are over, and the beautiful days of spring come. Saeng’s mother states, ""…it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months…. That’s what matters"". The winter hibiscus is a direct parallel to saeng in that just like it, she is strong enough to survive the winter months."
