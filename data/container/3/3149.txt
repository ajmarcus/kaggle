"The early @DATE1's was a time where everyone was out to find and build the next best thing. In @CAPS1, two tycoons were competing to build the tallest building in the world. Al Smith, the man creating the Empire State building, had an idea to make his building taller and more popular; build a mooring mast for dirigibles on the top of his building. Though a good and creative idea, the obstacles his architects would face would turn out to be more than they bargained for.first off, putting a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building was very unpractible without changing the whole design."" The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and Strengthened to accommodate this new situation"", (@CAPS2 @NUM1). Also, the dirigible would put so much stress on the foundation of the building. ""The Stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation...,"" (@CAPS2 @NUM1). Nature was also a giant obsitacl these architects faced while building this. ""The greatest obstical to the suceessful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"", (@CAPS2 @NUM3)As you can see, these architects faced many challenges while building this mast, that saddly never paid off in the end."
