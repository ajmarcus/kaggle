"The builders of the Empire State building faced Problems to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some Problems were that most dirigibles from other countries are filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable, also The winds at the top of the building were constantly Shifting due to violent air currents and could cause the dirigible to wrap around the building. Another @CAPS1 the builders faced was a existing law against airships flying to low in urban areas, this law would make it illegal for the dirigible to even come near the building. They also had to spend @MONEY1 to upgrade the framework so it does not put to much strain on the top of the building."
