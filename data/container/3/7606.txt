The mood first develops in the first paragraph, when Narciso writes of his parents immigrating from Cuba and being able to move up from a one room to a three room apartment. The second appearance of this mood is when the author writes of how their community came together and helped eachother through the segregation and racism of the time period. The third and last demonstration of the mood is how the parents took what they could get and made their house, into a home. Accomplishment, is the mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives""."
