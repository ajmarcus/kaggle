"The mood created in the memoir is very loving and caring and it shows appreciation to the authors parents. The author (@ORGANIZATION1) explains how it was for him as a kid and his ""family"" doesn't always mean a blood relative. He describes the household as being very humble and always had open arms and welcomed others. He also says that it wasn't about the size of the home or how expensive it was, it was about the people inside it and how close they were and the memories they shared. All in all through this memoir @PERSON1 (the author) shows that he is very appreciative of his family and wouldn't change how we grew up and thanks his ""family"" for impressing the spirit of generosity upon him in an early age."
