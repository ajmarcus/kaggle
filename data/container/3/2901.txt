"They were many obstacles the @ORGANIZATION2 of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of those obstacles was the stress of the dirigibles's load and the wind pressure didn't allow to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, in which was nearly @NUM1 feet below. Another things that was an obstancle for the @ORGANIZATION2 was it was alot of money it was over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. Also the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the @ORGANIZATION1 flat roof. The last obstacle was it safety. Most of the dirigibles from outside of the United States uses hydrogen rather then helim, which hydrogen is highly flamable. This let to a accident on May 6, 1937, the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it happened in dowtown New York. This are some obtecles the @ORGANIZATION2 of @ORGANIZATION2 faced."
