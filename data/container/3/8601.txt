"The mood described by the auther was warm and full of happiness. In the memoir, the auther @ORGANIZATION1 talks about the importance of his family Which always brings a comforting feeling. He Shared that he ""was born into a two-family blond-brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New jersey"" but that it did not matter where he lived but who he lived with. The mood you get when you read this memoir is mixed because Of the way he describes his parents life, his life and his home. When he says ""the innocence of Childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" he is talking about how close they all are and that, that is what matters, when you read that you feel the comfort, happiness, joy and compassion that he feels toward his life, his parent and everyone around him."
