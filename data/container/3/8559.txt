"The mood of the memoir was heart-warming. The way Narciso Rodriguez wrote the memoir was looking back at his life as half full, not as half empty. Instead of pointing out or remembering the bad things about his childhood, he writes about the good parts of his childhood. For example, his parents gave him oppurtunitys despite their struggle. His parents made their home a happy place to be, even though they were going through times of rasism and segregation. Also because of his parents positive attitude, it made him a positive person. Another reason the mood was heart-warming was now Narciso's parents demonstrated with their lives and teachings how important family and friends are. Narciso's parents have given up and done so much for him, resulting in who Narciso Rodriguez is today, makes this memoir truly heart-warming."
