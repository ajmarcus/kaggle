"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a loving mood. In the memoir, the author talks a lot about family. And even though they weren't blood related, he considered many people his family. In the text it says ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all these cultures came together in great Solidarity and Friendship. It was a close-knit community...."" @CAPS1 example of the mood being loving is the author talks about his parents being selfless and leaving so much behind. And they did all that just to make sure he got a better life. In the memoir it says ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" Also, the mood is loving because the author talks about how grateful he is. He's grateful to how much his parents did so much for him and others. In the story it says ""I will never forget how my parents turned that simple house into a home."" @CAPS2 are ways that explain why this memoirs mood is a loving mood."
