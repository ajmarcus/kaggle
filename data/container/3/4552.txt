"The setting of this short story has a big affect on the cyclist. Since the story takes place in the desert, the temperature is very hot. The cyclist only packed enough water for the intended trip. Since he made a few wrong turns, he ended up needing more water. There were no signs of civilization so he could not stop any where and buy water. He came to a run-down rusty fauret and tried to drink water from it, but it was hot and tasted like battery acid. If this short story had a different setting, then the story would not make much sense. For example, if the story would have taken place in @LOCATION1 he could have just stopped and bought water. The setting is one of the most important elements in a story."
