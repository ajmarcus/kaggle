"There were many obstacles that builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles were that architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. This is because as it says on paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" Another obstacles were making the mooring mast of the Empire State Building to fulfill its purpose. It was very hard to make the mooring mast fulfill its purpose because the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. In paragraph @NUM2 it states that, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These are the reasons why the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the building."
