"In this short passage, it discusses how architects want to build a mooring mast on the Empire State Building in the state of New York. This mast would dock dirigibles, which in modern day they're called blimps. The mooring mast is a skinny tower at the top of the Empire State Building to dock the Dirigibles. Empire State Building stands @NUM1 feet tall without the mooring mast at peak.The stress of a dirigible on a mooring mast at @NUM2 feet is a lot of weight at that high of a structure. They put @MONEY1 of modifications into this deal for the base area of the building.An important downfall about the dirigibles are that with helium in them, they're very flammable and could cost several millions in damage. If the zeppelin caught on flame over such a densely populated land area, that could take a large amount of lives.I think the mooring mast was a great idea and it helped the building be the tallest building at one time. They should still use the mooring mast today."
