"Many features of the setting affected the cyclist. First, the heat was the main part of nature that threw him off. It caused him to go dehiderated because lack of water and he went kind of dilerious. He thought he was seeing things and his vision was distorted. Next, the water he had to come across in the pump was un drinkable because of the tarlike substance coming out of it and the degree of water he said it was, which was @NUM1 degree. Lastly, the Welchs factory that he came across was teasing him in in the way that he couldnt have the liquids he needed and the little boy advertised on the building was drinking his refreshed Welchs juice. Not only did the cyclist get off track because the directions, the setting made his bike adventure to Yosemite even more unbearable."
