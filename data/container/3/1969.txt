"Based on excerpt, ""The Mooring @CAPS1,"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced certain obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as the violent air currents, and the safety of pedestrians.One obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the violent air currents. According to the excerpt, the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting. So if a dirigible happened to get caught in this they would be dangling high above pedestrians. Example of this would be, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring @CAPS1 the back of the ship with swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (@NUM1) Another obstacle was the safety of pedestrians. When owners heard about the German dirigible, Hindenburg, was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, they decided that it would be even worse if it had taken place in a heavily populated place like New York. An example of this would be, ""owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York.""In conclusion, the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"", written by Marcia Amidon Lsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced certain obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Such as the violent air currents and the city pedestrians."
