"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, Narciso Rodriguez creates a powerful mood for the reader. First, right of the bat I felt love and thoughtfulness, which I still felt throughout the story. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This made me think of my parents immediately. My father gave up his career and my mother gave up her family to give me and my brothers a better life. This feeling is without words. I can't describe the level of gratefulness I feel, just as Narciso does. Secondly, the admiration I shared with Narciso. She described her parents well enough to put me in her shoes. ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and @CAPS1 thanked them repeatedly."" What her parents did for her was incredible and something to learn from. From Narciso's story, I got a sense of admiration, greatfulness, and connection, which I believe are the moods she created throughout his story."
