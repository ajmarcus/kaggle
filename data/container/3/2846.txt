"From the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, it describes many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The mooring Mast of the building was destined to never fulfill its purpose. One example is most dirigibles from the outside the United States used hydrogen. The united States mainly used helium, witch is not flamable like hydrogen. Luckily the owners of the Empire State Building understood that there could have been a terrible accident if hydrogen dirigibles were used at the Empire State Building. Another obstacle to the builders was nature. the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of the violent air currents. This made it unsafe for the pedestrians down below. these are the obstacles the builders had when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock."
