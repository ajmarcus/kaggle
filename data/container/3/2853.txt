"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders went through many obstacles. Dirigibles are steel frames balloons, with envelopes or cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air. Dirigibles could be maneuvered by the use of propellers and rodders and passengers could ride in the gondola, under the balloon.A dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. over @MONEY1 worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework. Also the law against airships flying to low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."
