"There are many ways the cyclist is affected throughout the essay by the setting. As he first enters the short cut that the old men give him he is confidenc. When he arrives at the first town and sees that it is like a ghost town he does not fret but continues on his journey in confidence. As he got to the second stop his lack of water began to set in, I got down on my hands and knees working the handle of the rusted water with all my strength. This shows he will work hard and is in need of water. As the cyclist past another place with no hope of water he placed stones in his mouth because he once heard it helped get your mind off thirst when he had just about lost hope from travelling through the hot @CAPS1 desert with no water he found one lost drive in him when he saw a store with water. Though this was a hot harsh setting it created inspiration for him to keep going and push through the hard times and survive."
