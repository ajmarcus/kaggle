"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize her new found determination to overcome her obstacles. For example, in the passage she states, Òshe realized that many of the things she had thought strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiarizes to her.Ó At this point she has an epiphany, and realizes that life is like seasons. In the end paragraph she intercedes this by saying that in the spring she will take the test again. This shows that just as the winter hibiscus is along winter, and then blooms in the spring, she must be strong during these hard times. One day her time will come for her to Òbloom.Ó @CAPS1 experiences hard times, but we all must be strong and steadfast as we wait for our time to Òbloom.Ó "
