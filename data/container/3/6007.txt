"The author chose to end the story with the final paragraph for several reasons. Saeng states that she will retake her driving test in the spring. Archetypically, spring symbolizes a new start or new opportunity. Ending the story with this archetype shows that later on, Saeng has a new chance to succeed at her test and also to make the best of being in @LOCATION1 and adapt to her new life. When she buys the hibiscus plant, she remembers her old home and all the wonderful memories she has of it. The plant seems to give her hope and the last paragraph of the story mentions the hibiscus. This shows that having the hibiscus around will give her hope of passing her test and also of adjusting to @LOCATION1 while remembering her old home in Vietnam"
