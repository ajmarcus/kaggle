"The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.  One obstacle that faced the builders was that the dirigibles could not simply land on top of the building.  The thousand foot dirigible would add stress to the frame of the building.  They would have to ""transmit"" the load and the wind pressure to the foundation which was nearly eleven hundred feet below.  The builders had to make over @MONEY1 worth of modifications.  Another reason was nature.  As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting"".  The dirigible could not be teathered down because the lead weights would be dangling above pedestrians.  A final obstacle was an already existing law.  The law was against airships flying too low over urban areas.  This made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building.  These obstacles destined the mooring mast to never fulfill its purpose."
