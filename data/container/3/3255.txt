"The builders of the Empire state building faced many problems in trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the top @CAPS1 ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" @CAPS2 the designers had to find a way for the dirigible to dock at the top of the building. Even if they did find a way for it to dock though, ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This set the builders back again because even if they did find a way to dock the dirigible the Empire state building would need ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications."" Even though that's possible there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The builders faced many obstacles that set them back but they made a valiant attempt to see their dream come true."
