"The builders and the architects faced many issues in making this project of extending the Empire State Building to 1,250 feet height. Though they planned their steps into making the mooring mast on top was unrealistic. It was unrealistic because this was never done before on top of a building. Another obstacle they faced was safety of the passengers and in general, because most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, which was highly flammable. Another obstacle they faced was with the weather, because landing a dirigible on top of the building with fast winds due to the violent air currents was also dangerous for the people on the dirigibles and could've possibly hit other building by swiveling around in the air from the winds. The last obstacle the builders faced, was that their project was illegal, against the federal law because the dirigibles would be flying to close to urban areas such as New York City, so therefore be impossible to accomplish, as shown in paragraph @NUM1. In this paragraph it states ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. This shows prof of the project's incapability to be built."
