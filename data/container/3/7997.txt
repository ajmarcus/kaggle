"In the memoir Narciso rodriguez by Home, the mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is that growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life. but, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.  I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."
