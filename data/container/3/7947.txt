"The mood of this memoir is grateful and content. The author @CAPS2 this mood with his quotes that @CAPS1 puts in. ""I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey."" That @CAPS2 that the author did not care that much about house looks, price or its location. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of family... [that it] had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" @CAPS1 is grateful for all the people that @CAPS1 now considers his ""family"". Also, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life"". That @CAPS2 right in the quote that @CAPS1 is feeling grateful! The author also puts some phrases in parentheses, just to add a bit more, ""(after which I eternally grateful)"", ""(which I adore to this day)"". Those show @CAPS1 is happy and grateful with his life, and last this next quote @CAPS2 that his ""family"" members were all grateful for each other. ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necissarily their own kind, were clearly in need""."
