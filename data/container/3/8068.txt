"While reading Narciso Rodriguez I felt a certain mood. the mood was very serious and grateful. In the memoir Narciso said, ""I will always be thankful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" this shows he is thankful for all his parents Did to make him the man he is today. He also writes, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" That statement is a serious thought that clearly came from the heart. It shows he has love for anyone who comes close to him. to add, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage."" that says that he thinks about his parents and having heart, and courage, and that is both serousness and gratefulness. In closing I would like to say Narciso Rodriguez is a very grateful and serious man."
