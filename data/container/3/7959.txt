"The mood created by the author was love from his family The author describes ""a love of (cuban) cooking which is still with me (the author) today"" and how ""Passionate cuban music which I (the author) still adore today."" The author got this love from his parents. Another way the author created the mood of love was by talking about how his ""parents always kept there arms and door open."" I know that it takes a lot to be able to let anyone into your home. The authors speaking very lovingly at this point in the story. The author also says that he ""will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice."" This also sets the mood of the story because they are talking about a loving relationship The mood that the author set during the story was love. I think that this was a really good mood to set in a story."
