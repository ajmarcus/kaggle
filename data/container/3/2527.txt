"The obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was dificult. The builder met with experts to better understand the way the dirigibles work. He also was told that architects couldn't put a mooring mast on top because of the buildings flat roof. Paragraph nine States a thousand-foot dirigible- held by a single cable tether would add stress to the buildings frame."" The stress would then be passed all the way down to the buildings foundation, nearly eleven hundred feet below. The builder put over sixty thousand dollars' worth of changes into the building. After all that time and money he was told that the plan would have to fall through. The dirigibles greatest obstacle was the wind, if it moved in the air that could be a problem. Although this plan didnt work, its still 1,250 ft and taller than the Chrysler building."
