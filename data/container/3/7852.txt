"The mood created by the author in this memoir is love. Narciso and his family had so much love that they were able to overcome struggles and help others to overcome by allowing them to stay in their home, and live with them. They allowed people who weren't even apart of their family to become part of their family, they loved and cared for other, possiably even more than them selves and gave up everything they had in cuba to come to america for a better future for their children. The amount of love in this house is what turned it form an ordiary house and into a loving, caring, compassionate, and selfless home, not only for Narciso but for everyone in the community, and family"" that was created. That is what the mood of this memoir was, and in whom created it."
