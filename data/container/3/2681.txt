"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles docked there. Based on excerpt, one of these obstacles were the lack of suitable landing area. The dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City. Another obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. If they got close enough to tie up, the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers because of the fear that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigibles shell. Also, for the dirigible to be added, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework."
