"In Narciso's memoir, I feel joy. I feel joy because Narciso's parents were able to survive. They came to @LOCATION1, ""without any knowledge of the language or culture."" @CAPS1 immigrant families do not get on there feet right away and they did, within a year they went from a @NUM1 room apartment to a @NUM2 room appartment.Joy came to my mind also because they had welcoming arms to there family. People today are losing there jobs & homes and they have nobody to go to, but the Rodriguez family had a place to go. ""Countless extaded family members came & went- and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms & their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."""
