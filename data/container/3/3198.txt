"After planning and building the mooring mast on top of the empire state building, the developers found many problems that were not thought of earlier. They hadn't thought about the flammability of the gases inside of the dirigibles. Nor had they remembered the ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building"" (lines @NUM1). Also, the heavy winds that would be found that high above the ground would certainly prove to be a danger to all the airships. If they had hit a neiboring building the results could be disastrous."
