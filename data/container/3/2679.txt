"Based on the excerpt the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of the obstacles were safty factors and nature its self.Safty was a big obstacle in this plan for a morning mast because the dirigibles use hydrogen to float these big ships. Hydrogen is highly flammable and the owners of the Empire State Building relized how bad it would be if the dirigibles were to cech of fire over a highly populated city like New York. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, May 6, 1937, the owners relized how much worse that accident could have been in New York.""The greatest obstacle was nature. Humans couldn't control wind and ontop of the building they were constantly changeing makeing it hard to dock. ""The winds ontop of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The mooring mast couldn't be done."
