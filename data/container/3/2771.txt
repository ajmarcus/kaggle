"@ORGANIZATION3 writes in her excerpt The Mooring Mast"" of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to create a dock for dirigibles. In late 1929 Al Smith was confident of the height and use the building would achieve. Those working on the project of the mooring mast consulted with experts from the U.S. Naval Air Station but eventually found the project too much to handle.The mast never fulfilled its intended use due to the numerous issues they faced, the main one of which being nature itself. Docking a dirigible at the high altitude of the building's peak through proved practically impossible. The danger of the project to civilians of New York was a flaw as well due to the inability to keep a dirigible controlled in wind and the high flammability of the vehicles. Legally speaking there was another issue concerning a law that would not allow a dirigible to fly at the altitude required to dock.The idea of the mooring mast was an interesting and had it been realized dirigibles may have become significantly more popular. However the mooring mast was impractical and obstacles it posed overcame the ambition used to design it."""
