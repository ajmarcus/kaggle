"The cyclist was riding in some rough, dry and abandoned terrain that made his journey almost fatal. He described it as, “In the high deserts of California in June.” It was dry, lifeless and hot The sun was beating on him and he needed to frequently drink water, but he was running out. The empty towns were what he was wanting on for fresh water, but they’d been very abandoned. This made his journey very dangerous. He could’ve fallen off at any time because of heat stroke He would’ve died right then and there. His sweat was drying in the heat and there was no way for him to cool off in the lifeless desert: lifeless and dry. He had to enhance these extreme. Ironical conditions for miles on end, just to find some water. It was all that a desert is and all that a home shouldn’t go through."
