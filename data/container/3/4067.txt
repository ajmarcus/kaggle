The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist should had looked at his map instead of taking the old man advise because all the information was on the map. He almost died because he listened to the old men and didnt look at his map. If the cyclist was in a car mabey he would have better luck because he would be going  faster than the @NUM1 bike.
