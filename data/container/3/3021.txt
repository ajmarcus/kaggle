"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. A big problem with safety: most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Another reason was when dirigibles moored in open landing fields, they could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building would not work out due to the highly populated New York and dangling over pedestrians.Another reason was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even aproach the area. Even if it could, there was worries that the dirigible would be punctured by other obstacles on surrounding buildings."
