The architects had to acomidate a lot of thing to allow dirigibles to dock at The mooring mast. For example In @CAPS1 @NUM1 it says ""The steelframe of the Empire State Building would have to modify and strengthen to accommodate this new situation"". Also in @CAPS1 @NUM2 it says ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was natur itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". These factores and many more where the reason the mooring mast was never poot to use do to the feer of safty and law."
