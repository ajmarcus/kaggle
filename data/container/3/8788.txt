"The author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates a mood in ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives."" The mood of this memoir could be described as nostalgic or even love to some extent (as in loving his old home, family, friends, ect.) The author mentions ""endless celebrations ... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This helps create the mood because the author is reminicing on the events that happened in his home (in this case, they were very happy memories) The author mentions in paragraph @NUM1 that during a time of racism in the @CAPS1 his community was so close-knit that people were like family. He even states: ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" These examples from the memoir help create a nostalgic mood, it also shows the love throughout the community. Finally, in paragraph @NUM2 the author says he ""will never forget"" the things he ""learned there about how to love."" Which builds on these two themes as well (due to the fact he is remembering the feeling of love he expirienced and learned.) In conclusion, the mood(s) of this story would be of nostalgic and/or love."
