"When designing the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles, the builders came across a few obstacles. A dirigible is a blimp filled with hydrogen and/or helium to keep it lightly in the air. What the builders did not realize ahead of time was that hydrogen is a highly flammable gas. If it is docked on top of a building around movement it could easily catch on fire creating the whole building itself to blow up. Another obstacle that the builders noticed would occurred was the forceful winds. With a dirigible dock so high up in the air, it creates an unstable way for people to get off of it. The vicious winds would make the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast because only the front would be weighed down. The last obstacle that was found with docking a dirigible, was that it would be too low to an urban area. The dirigible would be too close to walking pedestrians, creating an un-safe enviroment if something was too go wrong. Without taking that chance, it was agreed that there were too many obstacles; therefore, the idea of docking a dirigible on top of the Empire State Building was cancelled."
