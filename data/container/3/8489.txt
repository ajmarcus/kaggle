"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez is happines. @CAPS1 shows happiness by showing @CAPS1 wanted nothing more that to be with his family doing the things @CAPS1 loved, which @CAPS1 did. @CAPS1 also shows that @CAPS1 is greatful.  ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 feels @CAPS1 could never be as ""courageous"" as his parents and @CAPS1 thanks them for that, ""I've thanked them repeatedly."" I think the overall mood of this memoir is joy and happines.There is a flowchart on the bottom of the page, @NUM1 columns: one is mood, the other support. Under mood is happy and grateful. Under support for happy is ""like @CAPS1 wanted nothing more"". For grateful is written (@NUM2)."
