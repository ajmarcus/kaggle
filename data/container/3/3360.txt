"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted the builders had to face many obstacles while constructing the Empire State building to be able to allow drigibles to dock there. The builders had to face many obstacles such as laws @CAPS1 Changes and the building @CAPS2, that was not thought about while the idea was accumulating. After creating the plan to add a mast on the top of the empire State building a docking for Dirigibles, the new airships they finally decided to look at the defaults of the already developed plan. While the mask was being designed architects realized that you ""could not simply drop a moorning mast on top of the Empire States building's flat roof."" ""A thousand-foot drigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". When the builders were constructing their plan they didnt consider the fact that the load of the dirigibles would add stress to the entire building. ""The greatest obstacle to a successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The builders realize that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents and since the law was against airships flying too low over urban areas the dirigibles idea wouldnt be as easy to fulfill with all of the obstacles to over come. The obstacles the builders had to face When attempting to dock dirigibles on the empire state building were safety laws, weather and the building @CAPS2."
