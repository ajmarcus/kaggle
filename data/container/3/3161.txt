"The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there because of ""nature itself"" and the past problems that happened.An obstacle that the builders faced was providing safety. After the fire in Lakehurst, @LOCATION3, the builders were worried about the issues that might occur, especially when it takes place in downtown New York.Another obstacle was ""nature itself."" Because of the mooring mast being on top of the building, the builders were frightened because of the violent air currents.The last obstacle was that it was a law that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. So it was illegal for an airship to be tied on a building.The builders faced three main obstacles - ""Nature itself,"" a past accident, and the law. Unfortunetly, they were unable to continue their work because the obstacles were just too strong."
