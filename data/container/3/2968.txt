"Based on the information I just read the obstacles the builders had of the empire building, was to find a way to allow the dirigibles to dock there. There are rooms that have been never opened to public and is the highest observation desk. They had to make room for a dock but they didnt know how to. The builders faced was the city didnt want ""dirigibles to moor at the empire state building because the law agianst airships flying to low over urban areas. They also had complications the captain of the dirigibles shell could not let go of the control levers. The sharp spires of other buildings could pop the dirigibles. The wind was also a problem as it could take the dirigibles a different dirrection."
