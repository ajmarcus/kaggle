"The builders of the dirigibles faced many obstacles trying to allow them to dock. One obstacle was there was a it was illegal for ""airships to fly to low"" over urban areas. It was illegal for it to ""tie up to the building. ""The purpose of the dirigibles was to be able to dock at the mast. If it couldn't fly up to the mast and dock there was no purpose in the mast or dirigibles. If they were to be able to dock they would need to be weighted down by lead weights. The problem with the weights was they would dangle above pedestrians. That was ""neither practical nor safe"" for the pedestrians on the street. If the dirigible docked at the top of the building, they would be held by a single cable. All the pressure on the cable would stress out the buildings frame. If that were to happen they would then have to strengthen and modify the buildings foundation. Overall the major obstacle they faced was not thinking through their plan of the dirigible. If they had thought it through these obstacles could have been prevented."
