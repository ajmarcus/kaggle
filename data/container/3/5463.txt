Something. I was able to extract from the fact that she wants to wait for the hibiscus is the presence of confort, the whole story revolves around how saeng was able to confort herself by reminiscing on her past experiences in Vietnam.

I think the author would conclude the story with this paragraph is because the author wants to stress the importance of this flower involving how saeng lives her life"
