"As the cyclist continues on his ride, changes begin to occur in the surroundings, which ultimately affects the cyclists attitude. When first starting out on his journey to Yosemite, the cyclist started out that morning, with strong legs and a smile on my face. He had received information from a few of the older locals that would help to cut the amount of time it took to arrive at Yosemite National Park. However, as he was riding, the cyclist realized that perhaps the older mens travel advice was a little out dated. with barely any water left to hydrate himself, and being surrounded by nothing but more road and desert, the cyclist couldnt help but laugh. It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. At this point, the cyclist was mad at himself for not just using the map that he had brought with him instead of listening to the locals. Although the cyclist remained determined to find water, he had begun to lose hope when he suddenly came across a bait store. Here he was able to rehydrate himself, and with his renewed spirit, continued on his journey, this time using his map."
