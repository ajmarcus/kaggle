"@PERSON1 uses a very happy tone and mood when talking about his home. ...Passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and For which I am eternally grateful). Narciso is very happy he learned such great cooking in his childhood. ""Here, in the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (@NUM1). Being so happy made this such a warm home in @CAPS1. ""I will never Forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@NUM2). Narciso summed up his entire article in one sentence and creating what most people feel at home. At my home I feel everything Narciso does because its not were you live its how you live."""
