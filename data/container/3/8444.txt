"The mood created by @PERSON1 in the memoir from Home The Blueprints of Our Lives is one of generosity and friendship. From an early age, @PERSON1 recounts how more often than not there would be a guest at his table. It could be Alegria his ""babysitter and first friend,"" his surrogate grandparents, or any number of friend and relatives. There was a constant ""congregation of Friends and family"" they generously hosted, because his Family knew that because of their generosity, they would always be welcome at other people's houses. ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This constant congregation of Friends and family in @PERSON1's home, creates a mood of generosity and friendship throughout the memoir."
