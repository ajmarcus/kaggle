"When the idea of creating a moring post for dirigibles on top of the empire state building there were several problems engeneers failed to reconize. The first was the problem of using highly flamable hydrogen to fill the dirigibles. The Hindenburg accident showed how horible it is one one of these explodes. The situation would have been much worse had it been over @NUM1 stories in the air. Secondly violent wind gusts would have made it  imposible to dock the dirigible atop the building, especially when the use of custimary lead weights would be both unsafe and not pratical. Lastly there was a law imposed before this project was ever a thought making it unlawful to fly any airship that low to an urban area."
