"After Saeng fails her driver’s test, she gives up hope for the future. The sight of the hibiscus plant reminds her to never give up, no matter how tough the situation. In the story, Saeng’s mother says, “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matters.” This quote shows how even though its not an object of beauty, it can do what it takes to survive. Saeng feels that she is also like the hibiscus, having the strength to be able to survive in a new environment. Even though she is new to this country, Saeng had proved that no matter how big the situation, anything can be overcomed if you believe in yourself and your family."
