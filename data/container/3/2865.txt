"The building of the mooring mast on top of the empire state building was very poorly thought out. This is the reason why they faced so many obstacles. From the very start Al Smith never thought about the safety of the people. ""When other countries used hydrogen rather than helium this was a cause for very flammible possibilities. If this happened in New Jersey how bad would it be in a densely populated place like New York City. I could never imagine walking down the street and a lead weight being dropped on my head. In New York there was violent air currents and when the dirigibles would be tied up they would sway. The idea was to hold them in place by lead weights. This was not practical or safe. The one thing that should have been thought of before it was ever constructed was the law. It was illegal for a airship to fly low over urban areas or even to tie up to buildings. In conclusion everything should have been thought out before making hype about something that was not safe, and that was illegal."
