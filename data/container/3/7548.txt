"In the memoir, the author created a mood. The mood was a very good one that shows everyone that reads it, that the human race can be genuinely kind and helpful. No matter what race you are or where you come from, you don't have to be blood related to be ""family"" and we can all extend a hand to the people that need the most help. The author's parents gave him great love and sacrificed alot for him; @CAPS1 is very thankful to them for that. @CAPS1 tells them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then @CAPS1 could've ever done and @CAPS1 has great admiration for their strength and perseverance. Being an immagrant you have to be unselfish because most parents do it to give their children a better life. The author learned the real definition of ""family"" and for that, @CAPS1 said @CAPS1'll never forget that house or the many things about how to love. In the memoir, it creates a peaceful mood."
