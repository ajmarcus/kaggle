"The author of the memoir creates a very loving, peaceful, and happy mood in the story. It is always saying that his house was always filled with friends and family. This gives the story a very loving mood and shows how they are all there for each other. Also, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to lif in our warm home."" This sentence shows that the home is very loving and warm. Lastly, the mood that Narciso has throughout the memoir is very greatful. He is always saying how much he appreciates what his parents did by moving to @LOCATION1 to create a better life for him. That is the mood of the memoir throughout the whole passage."
