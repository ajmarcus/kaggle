"The mood of the memoir by @PERSON1 is love and compassion for his parents. He tells how he grew up with pride for Cuba and how he still loves Cuban music. His parents gave him these qualities which he adores but he is ""eternally grateful for his rich culinary skills that were passed on to him by his parents. @PERSON1 also talked about the role of ""family"" in the environment in which he grew up in. In his neighborhood, many people were the victims of racism, so they all came together to be a stronger whole. By growing up like this he learned how to give a helping hand to those who were in need. @PERSON1 also told the reader of the courage his parents had by leaving everything they knew and loved behind and how he wished he could have that same courage, but at least he knew of it."
