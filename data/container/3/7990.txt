"I feel that the mood (s) created by the author in the memoir is happy, proud, and grateful. I think that the author makes the memoir feel happy because he is saying that his parents were kind and they worked hard and that made him happy I think.Another mood I think is he was proud. He said (in paragraph @NUM1) that growing up in his environment istilled a great sence of family. His family welcomed other refugees from cuba to celebrate their arrival to this country. Thanks to what he grew up in he learned the real definition of family.The last mood I feel the author created was he was grateful. He said in paragraph @NUM2 that ""I will always be grateful for my parents love and sacrifice. He is gratful to his parents and how they ""turned a simple house into a home"" (paragraph @NUM3). That's what I feel the mood (s) are in the memoir are."
