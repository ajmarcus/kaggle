"In order for the dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building the builders had to fulfill many expectations and make sure everything was right, but while doing that they faced many obstacles. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Another obstacle the builders faced was most dirigibles from outside of the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flameable. They realized how much worse it could be especially with a more populated area like downtown New York. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. With all of These obstacles the builders realized that this would not work."
