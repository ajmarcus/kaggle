"After reading, Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit, I noticed that the setting of this adventure affected the narrator. First of all, the heat cause the narrator to be uncomfortable and thirstier. While on the moving, he refers to the trip as a ,water-deplating one this quote shows that he was lacking water and that this was a major problem. Also it refers to the road as rolling hills"", and this shows the reader that they seem to go on forever. This lowers the narrators hope of getting there quickly. Also the desert gives the author low hope of reaching his destination. The setting affects the narrator both physically and mentally."
