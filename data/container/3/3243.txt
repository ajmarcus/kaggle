"Constructing a building was hard, but attempting to build the world's tallest building was intense. The mast a top the Empire State Building caused many obstacles for the builders such as having to strengthen the frame work of the whole building. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the Empire State building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's framework."" The architects also wanted to make the mooring mast ornamental, or decorative. ""Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects design is shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside-."" @CAPS1, the building had to have two extra floors added one ""open observation platform"" and a ""boarding area for dirigidle passengers. Even though the mast was doomed to never fulfill its purpose, the building was still hailed the world's tallest building."
