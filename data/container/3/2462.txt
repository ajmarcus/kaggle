"On December 11, 1929, Al Smith Announced that the Empire State building would be reaching the height of 1,250 feet; taller then the previous largest building, the Chrysler Building. Smith made the building taller by adding a top or a hat. John @CAPS1 described this as ""[The top of the empire State Building] would be more than an ornament... The empire state building would be equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of a few aviation pioneers"" (pg 1). This dream consisted of having a mooring mass at the top of the building to dock dirigible, or blimbs. However, many obsticles emerged the more they began to plan this, such as the amount of stress it would add to the buildings frame, the use of hydrogen opposed to helium, and simply nature itself. ""A thousand-foot drigible held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame... The Empire State building would have to... [have] over @MONEY1 worth of modifications (pg @NUM1). ""Most diribles from outside of the U.S used hydrogen... and hydrogen is highly flammable (pg @NUM1)"". ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... they would be dangling high above pedestrians... that was neither safe nor practical"""
