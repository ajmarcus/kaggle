"In this memoir there is a mood created by the author. In the memoir the mood is like, calm and happy and relaxing. In the memoir the author is saying ""passionate cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" That was the mood of relaxing because when you hear music it relaxes you and when you smell something out of the kitchen that you like it relaxes you even more. Also in the memoir it says most of the people in the neighborhood was spanish, cuban, and Italian immigrants which were honest, hardworking immigrants who extend a hand to people. That was showing the calmness because if you know everyone of your neighbors are the same you dont have anything to worry about. The last mood is being happy thing that showed that is he was grateful for his parents. In the memoir the author says he is grateful fo his parents love, sacrifice, and courageous. An their admiration for their strength and perseverance. That was the mood created by the author in this memoir."
