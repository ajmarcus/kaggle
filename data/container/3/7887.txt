"In this memoir, the mood created by the author was heartwarming and apperciative. There were so many parts to this story that made me feel so warm and made me want to say ""aw"". For example, in paragraph @NUM1 where it states, ""was a close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people, not nessecarly of their own kind, were clearly in need"". This line showed me how much love there must've been. Also, that everyone cared about everyone else. When the author is showing how her parents left their country to come to @LOCATION1, you can tell how grateful the author is this is shown extremely clear in paragraph @NUM2 where it states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.I think this story made me realize that you need to apperciate what others do for you. This author was so greatful for her parents, and that is shown very clearly in this memoir."
