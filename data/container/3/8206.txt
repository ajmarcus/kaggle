"The mood that was created by the author was respect. For example it told the boy that you don't have to be a blood realative. For instance, the author states ""@CAPS1 up in this environment in stilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative"". Another reason, was that you should always help your family s during bad times. For example the book reads ""Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporilily until they were able to get back on their feet"". Thirdly, the boy will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. For instance the auother quotes ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."
