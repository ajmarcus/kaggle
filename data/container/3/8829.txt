"The mood in this memoir was very happy and grateful to be living in the house where Narciso had such good neighbors as family, who were close to him. Even though Narciso's neighbors weren't actually family (as in blood related) Narciso still felt comfortable with them as if they really were his family. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" @CAPS1 on their street the immagrents were like a family. They all carried for each other and were happy."
