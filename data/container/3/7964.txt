"The mood in the memoir is grateful. It is grateful in a few ways. One way is in paragraph six he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" This shows that he is grateful toward his parents because they moved to the @CAPS1 from Cuba. Another way is in paragraph @NUM1 he says ""my parents both shared cooking duties an unwittingly passed on to me they're rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I admired to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This shows that he is grateful toward his parents because of their Cuban culture and specifically their cooking skills being passed on to him. Those are some reasons why the mood of the memoir is grateful."
