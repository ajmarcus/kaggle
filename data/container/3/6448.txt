"Everything in the story is about to change. The winter will change to spring, the snow will melt and vanish, the geese will return, the hibiscus will bud, Saeng will also change and mature as well, Saeng is just like the hibiscus plant as the plant is out of place on the road, Saeng is out of place in the new country and she must adapt like the hibiscus plant. The plant looks different in the United States than in Vietnam because it matured and grew. That is what Saeng must do she must mature and grow in this new country. For example Saeng observed how different the plant looked in the shop window then in did in her home country. She was observing herself and how different she appeared as well. The reason for putting the paragraph at the very end was to show that she had matured already and putting it at the end to show that she had grown. Putting it at the beginning would not give the same effect. The hibiscus plant was able to sustain the harsh winters change. Saeng is able to do that as well and she made the silent vow to take that test again when she has matured just as the things around her have."
