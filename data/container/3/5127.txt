"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by when the story says “Twenty miles up the road. I came to a fork of sorts”, This statement from the story affected the cyclist because he didn’t know which way to go. Another feature that affected the setting is when the story says “I got on my hand and knees, Working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength”. That statement shows that the cyclist was dieing for water and he didn’t think any was going to come out. Last feature that affected the cyclist was when the story says “Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit. This shows that the rider had to go under a speed limit but he was earlier tired and he was going way under it and that he could make it up the rough road."
