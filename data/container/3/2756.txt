"The builders faced many obstacles when trying to make it possible to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. They could not add an all steel mooring mast on top of the building because it would add too much stress to the frame and foundation of the building. If they were going to add a mooring mast, they needed to modify and strengthen the building's frame.The other problem the builders faced was safety. They had to consider the fact that may dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen, which was highly flammable. The Building was in a densely populated area in downtown New York City. The last obstacle the builders faced was nature. The winds on top of the building were very strong and the air currents frequently shifted. This would have made the dirigibles swivel around the mast."
