"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy and loving mood. It sets a loving mood whe the author says, ""Growing up in this enviornment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood realitive."" This sets a loving mood because the author is pretty much saying that a person can be so close to you and love you that you consider them family even though you are really not even related. It also sets a happy and loving mood when the author says, ""They came selflessly, as immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This quote shows that Narciso's parents love their children so much that they wanted them to have better lives and to be happy. That is the mood created by the author in this memoir."
