"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock were very difficult. difficult. One difficulty that they had was that the mooring mast nature it self. When the dirigibles would come to the building, the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air current, and the only way that they could moor is if the weighted down the back, and using them at the Empire State Building won't be practical or safe, with pedestrians below you.Another obstacle that the builders had was an existing law. the law was against airships flying to low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building, or even approach the area. this was an obstacle because they didn't have much to do about this since it's a government thing holding them back.These are just some obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock."
