"Early in the morning, the cyclist is eager and ready to face the adventurous path that had been mapped out by the older travelers. He hardly noticed the “sun was beginning to beat down.” He was calm and was looking forward to the “cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.” Never once did he imagine what he had gotten himself into. As he began to approach the desert, he noticed he was running low on water. The strenuous activity of biking combine d with the scorching heat of the desert began to take effect. The cyclist was so desperate for water that he had to put pebbles into his mouth. He had once read, “that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate.” The cyclist was hoping for a way out of the misery he had come across. Dehydration took it’s toll, and he felt hallucinations. He was beginning to lose hope. The heat and the hills and the lack of water had the greatest affect on the cyclist. Had he not been riding through a hilly desert one afternoon in June, he would have been fine."
