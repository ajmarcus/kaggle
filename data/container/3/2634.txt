"When building the empire state Building, the workers faced a few problems. One was how to make it @CAPS1, because the architect building the chrysler building had raised the total height, making it the largest building in the world. Al Smith, former governor of new york, said they were going to beat it by putting a mooring mast for the dirigibles. Another obstacle was @CAPS2 the mast to the top of the frame. It could not be dropped on, so sixty thousand dollars worth of maintenance had to be done to the frame. A third problem they had was tying up the dirigibles, violent winds could turn the Blimp around, possibly puncturing it. After the Hindenburg atrocity, the people in charge would not let blimps dock at the Building, for fear of endangering the Public. Thus, the mast was never used."
