"The mood created by the author in the memoir is to show gratefulness towards the author's parents. He wanted to portray the fact that his parents sacrifice their lives for the author's life.Narciso repeatedly conveys the message that ""family had nothing to do with being a blood relative"", but people who care for one another; people who ""come together in great solidarity and friendship"".The most important family to Narciso are his parents who sacrifice their lives, in order ""to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved"". He says that he will always be grateful to his parents. He admits ""that what they did was a much more courageous thing than ""he"" could have ever done"". Narciso infact, cannot thank his parents enough for showing them how important family and friends are.In the end, @PERSON1 realizes that a home is a place you live, and celebrate birthdays, and do work, but mainly a place where everyone is welcome and a home is a family in itself."
