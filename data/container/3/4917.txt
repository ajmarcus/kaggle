"The features of the setting greatly affect this cyclist. At first he is fine riding along the old-timers “shortcut” as he states that “things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” But what he didn’t know was this was the beginning of a very rough day. He arrived at the first “town” which was a ghost town. He wasn’t overly worried yet but at about sixty miles in on his journey he came to a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a broken down corral. The cyclist explains how he had drank a lot of his water and was in need of some. He tried the pumps but he explains how “a far like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” A couple miles later he came to a highway sign that read ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. The cyclist continued on desperate for water. He even came across a snake. He was now fearing a heat stroke. He came to an abandoned grape juice factory and hung his head. The cyclist then was almost completely dehydrated from the long, tiring bike rid. The cyclist was sure he was going to die from dehydration or a heatstroke that this terrible ride had caused. He finally came to a shop a drank from the sink. So this ride was torturous due to the setting."
