"The mood in the memoir changes. But overall the mood is sad. It tells how Narciso's parents give up what they had for the better of their children. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their Children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" Also, most of Narciso's family did not have homes for a while which is sad because they do not have a place to call home."" Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" Narciso's parents gave up everything for him to have a better life. They left the place they were most @CAPS1 in for him. ""The faith that is struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."""
