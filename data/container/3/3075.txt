The problems that the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the issues of safety. As said in paragraph @NUM1 the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Also said in paragraph @NUM1 there would be lead weights dangling above pedestrians on the street. one other problem they faced were the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.
