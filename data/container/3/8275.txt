"The mood that the author created in this memoir was love and gratefullness. The author is trying to get their message across about how much a family is bonded together and how much there is to be thankful for. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows how much love the author has to be grateful for. He is also trying to say that there is no way to express his emotions and love to his parents. ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The authors main point is to thank their parents for everything they have done. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"""
