"In the story Rough Road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie the feature of the setting seem negative to the cyclist. The setting seems to start worrying the cyclist two miles after he said that he could make the next @NUM1 miles easily. For example the cyclist says Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills, the cyclist seems worried at that point that things aernt going to be as easy as they seemed they were going to be. From that point on the setting seemed to get worse for the cyclist later on the cyclist ends up saying It didnt really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean. That was when the cyclist began to notice his fear of dehydration. The cyclist ended up making it and he realized what a big effect nature can have on you."
