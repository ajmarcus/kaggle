"In the memoir, ""@PERSON1"" from Home: ""The Blueprints of Our Lives"" writen by @PERSON1 the mood created by the author is grateful. The mood is grateful + thankful throughout the memoir. @PERSON1 is grateful that he had the parents he did. They showed him that you don't have to be blood-related to be family. Caring and always being there for each other and loving each other is just as important then having the same @CAPS1. He also has a lot of respect for his parents. They moved to @LOCATION1 for a better life but not only did the better theres but also others, the alwaysed welcamed friends, family and even people who just need help into their home and made them feel welcomed and loved. Thankful, grateful, and respected is the mood in this memior, that @PERSON1 felt."
