"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety reasons, weather conditions, and government laws, defeated the purpose of the mooring mast on top of the building. For example, many of the dirigibles used at the time contained hydrogen instead of helium, ""hydrogen is highly flammable... above a densely populated area."" (@NUM1). The builders realized this was not smart. Furthermore, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting do to violent air currents."" (@NUM2) This created a dangerous situation because the ship would swing around the mast. Lastly, the most obvious obstacle was a government law prohibiting a ship to even approach the building. ""...an existing law against airships flyinging too low over urban areas"" .(@NUM3) The whole idea that was built up to something great had slowly dwindled. The builders of the Empire State Building faced these obstacles, and many more, in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there."
