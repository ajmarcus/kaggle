"In the essay ""Rough Road Ahead; Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" by Joe kurmaskie, the setting is integral to how the cyclist feels and behaves. The cyclist feels a growing desperation as the setting around him gets progressively move bleak. In the beginning of the trip, the cyclist encounters a ghost town. ""I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" The cyclist is still thinking positively at this point in the essay. A while later, the cyclist comes across another abandoned set of buildings. He feels that this sight is ""troubling."" @CAPS1 the cyclist is worried, he is not yet depressive and pessimistic. Farther down the road, the terrain of the road changes, and he sees the sign that gives the essay its name."" The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water depleting @NUM1. Sometimes life’s can feel so cruel."" The cyclist’s surroundings get progressively worse as he rides on, but even tually he finds a place with working water. He is so overjoyed by this building that he wants to find the owners, and kiss them."
