"The workers that were building the extravagant Empire State Building they went through several obstacle courses. One of the obstacle courses having the blimp sit on top of building. Since the blimp was only held by one cable cord it was appling stress to the build because the blimp was pretty heavy. Another obstacle was nature. Since the Empire State Building was so high up the wind was excrushiating. The last obstacle they had to over come was the gas they used inside the blimps. If they used hydrogen which is a highly flammable substance, like the German blimbs it could of been bad."
