"The mood in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez stays constant through out the story. First, ""growing up in this environment in stilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative"". This quote talks about when Narciso's mom and dad take people in their house that need a home, but they are not blood relative family. Second, ""my mother and father came to this country not knowing the culture of language to give me a better life."" Even though his mom and dad knew nothing about the language or culture in @LOCATION1, and didn't want to leave friends and family, @ORGANIZATION1's mother and father sacrificed it all to give @CAPS1 a better life. Finally, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS2 means that its a simple house but it turned into a safe home with all the people @CAPS2 loves around him. All in all, the mood of this memoir is happy. The author makes all his challenges happy."
