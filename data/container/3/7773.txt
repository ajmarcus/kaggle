"The mood of the memoir created by the author was that he was very greatful for what his family has done. I know this because throughout the memoir he would always say how much he appreciated how his parents made this house into a Cuban home. I also know that the mood of the memoir by the author is greatful because he said how he liked that his neighborhood had many different cultures such as Spanish and Italian. The author also said ""I will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home."" That is what I think the mood of this memoir is."
