"In the memoir, ""@PERSON1,"" by Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, The mood is set right from the beginning. The first thing said to Start the mood was, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am extremely grateful.)"" This shows the author is grateful and happy. The memoir also said, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This shows how the author is very proud. Also lastly the memoir mentions, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This again saw how grateful the author is. In this passage the mood is set to be grateful, happy, and loving right from the start."
