"In ""The Mooring Mask"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted, In order to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders of the Empire State Building had to face obstacles. First, ""the lack of a suitable landing area"". They had to make room for the huge dirigibles to land. Second, ""add stress to the building's frame."" They had to make the structure of the building stronger so it wouldnt break. Lastly, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting"" if they were going to be able to make this work they needed to find a way to calm the wind by the tower. Hence, In ""The Mooring Mask"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted, in order to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders of the Empire State Building had to face obstacles."
