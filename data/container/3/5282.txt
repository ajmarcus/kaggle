"The features of the setting would have affected the cyclist a lot. There is a man who takes the advice of old men and takes a “shortcut” to Yosemite Park. The shortcut only leads him to thirst, and no park. The narration states, “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth couldstill be seen (Kurmaskie @NUM1). ""This feature could affect the cyclist by discouraging him. the cyclist comes to the first “town” but only finds yet again no water, and a picture of something that makes him more thirsty. It could also make him be more angry at the old men because they led him on this pointless journey. Another feature that @MONTH1 affect the cyclist is the lack of trees or shade. The only thing he could feel was the sun beating down on his back. The narration states, “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt.(Kurmaskie @NUM1).” This also makes the cyclist believe that old men do not know what they are talking about."
