"In this memoir written by fashion designer Narciso Rodriguez, there is a certain tone conveyed by his writing about his childhood home. Here is what is.Many people who immigrate from a poorer country like Cuba are quite poor when living here because like Narciso says in the bottom of paragraph @NUM1, ""In the United States, [my parents] had to start their lifes over entirely, taking what ever work they could find."" @CAPS1 of talking about the hardships, Narciso focused on the fact that he was raised into a wonderfly cultural enviorment. An enviorment filled with his ""family"". When he says family he doesn't meen just her biological family. He means all the people that he spends time with and has a deep connection with. Therefore, the mood that Narciso Rodriguez is conveying in this memoir is a warm, greatful, and happy tone. A tone that shows that he will never forget all the things his parents gave up so that he could have a good childhood. The tone also shows that now, even though he is a famous fashion designer and most likely is quite wealthy, he will never forget how his parents ""turned the simple house into a home."" This is what the tone of this memoir is."
