"The author concludes with this paragraph to show how the hibiscus flower profoundly implanted Saeng’s life and gave her new found courage and strength. For example, while on her way home after failing her driver’s test, Saeng sees a flower and says, “[I] felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.” This shows the deep concentration between Saeng and the hibiscus and it is this connection that will guide her through the tough times. Saeng subsequently was into a flower shop and identified all the flower there from her childhood. She realizes that her old home had all these flowers and Saeng used this connection to her past to further increase her courage in adapting into her knew life. Another example is when in the text it states, “She realized that many of the things she thought of was strange before had become…almost familiar to her now.” Saeng comes to this realization by listening to her mother talk of how the hibiscus flower which normally survived at her old home would be able to survive here. She understood that she too would be able to do so and not think things like big @CAPS1 here would be strange anymore. It is in this way that the hibiscus tree offers Saeng support, courage and even strength.  "
