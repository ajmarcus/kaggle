"There were several obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem they faced was they would have to change & fix the @CAPS1 of the Building in order to compensate for all the Stress there would be on the Building when the dirigibles landed. After they constructed & built the landing, there were several more problems. The first problem was that the hydrogen in the balloons is very flammable. This is a problem because New York is densely populated & with a flammable substance above there heads, it poses a threat. The second problem was the dirigible itself. It can easily blow in the wind, & would constantly wave in the wind, & unlike in a field, weights cold not be tied to the back of it because of the crowds below. The third & final problem they dealt with was the law: airships are not allowed too fly low over urban areas. The Empire State Building was too low in an urban area for anything to fly over it. Several of these problems led to the failure of the original idea & left the Empire State Building with a tall post of no purpose."
