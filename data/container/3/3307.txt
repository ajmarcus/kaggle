"The dream of the aviation pioneers of docking their dirigibles on the Empire State Building, created obstacles for the builders to face. The mooring mast of the building ""was destined to never fulfill its purpose,"" the author implying that the building should not have been built, because of all these obscured obstacles. One obstacle they faced was the violent winds on top of the building, due to air currents. It was difficult for the dirigibles to dock. The ""four-blocks"" length blimp, filled with helium and hydrogen, would be dangling high above, which was not safe for the millions of people on the streets. In December 1930, the dirigible Los Angeles could not get close enough to the mooring mast because of forceful winds. Another obstacle the builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The Columbia blimp tried to deliver bundles of newspapers to the building, ending up with papers dangling on the rope from the blimp, because the dirigible mooring equipment was never installed. Therefore it was ""desirable to postpone to a later date that the final installation of the landing gear"" that gave airplanes the title of ""transportation of the future."""
