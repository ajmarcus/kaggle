"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem that the workers faced was that a ""thousand-foot dirigible... would add Stress to the building's frame"" (@NUM1). This meant that the frame would have to be Strengthened. Another obstacle they came across was that there was a ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (@NUM2). Therefore, the it would be illegal to dock a ship on the building, because the airship would be too low down. Finally, the most difficult obstacle they encountered was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly Shifting due to violent air currents"" (@NUM3). This made it unsafe and unpractical because the dirigibles would be above pedestrians on the street. Due to all of the complications and challenges that faced the workers who were trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the project was never completed."
