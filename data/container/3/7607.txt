"The mood of this memoir was appreciative. The author reflects upon his experiences at home in a positive manner which expresses the fact that he is thankful for what he had. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful) (paragraph @NUM1). This quote shows Narciso's appreciation for the culinary skills his parents passed down to him. The extra information in the parentheses also provide a grateful tone to the piece of writing. Also in paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The language used (grateful) shows the intence thankfulness he feels. Throughout the entire reading the word ""grateful"" is used repeadtly. The use of repetition provides a reader with the knowledge that that word is very important. So grateful appears to be a keyword. Also, later in paragraph @NUM2 it says ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed on me at such a young age"" There is so much passion in this phrase. ""There is no way to express my gratitude"" shows that he's just so thankful there is not way to even express it. The author really shows the reader that he is appreicative of his family."
