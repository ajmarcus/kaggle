"The mood created by the author in the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is light-hearted. One piece of evidence of a light-hearted mood is in paragraph @NUM1 where it says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" @CAPS1 piece of evidence is in paragraph @NUM2 when it states, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Also, in paragraph @NUM3 it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" In conclusion, I feel the author created a light-hearted mood. "
