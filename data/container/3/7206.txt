"Reading this article expresses many different mood changing from the auther. While reading you can notice he's proud of his Cuban culter explaining how united his family has always been for as long as he can remember. Most important his so greatful to his parents for everything they've been through to see him sucuss in life and that's what I admire the most from the author. This story is giving thanks to his parents and his culture. He mood is mostly proud and thankful throughout the whole story. Like at the end when he says ""I learned the definition of ""family"", meaning his family was there for each other and and love was all over. This pasage made me realize everything my mother went through to see my brother and I success, so I can say I can relate to the auther."
