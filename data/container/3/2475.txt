"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The obstacles were safety, nature, and laws.Most foreign dirigibles used hydrogen which is highly flammable instead of helium. If a dirigible were to catch on fire above a very populated the city the outcome would be bad.The winds that high were very violent. There was no way to keep a dirigible still, even though the front is hooked to the building the back would swing. It was not safe.There was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. It was illegal to fly close to the building or to dock at it.The builders of the Empire state Building faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there."
