It means helping others, accepting everyone, and for his parents giving up your life so your children could have a better one. He recalls the many people his mother and father help. The people in his neighborhood that were not related by blood but were still his family. The courage and selflessness of his parents leaving their country to start over. He tells them of his ""...admiration of their strength and perseverance"" (¦@NUM1). There is still ""no way to express my gratitude"" (¦@NUM1), he also states. He will be forever grateful to his parents for these lessons that have formed his life."
