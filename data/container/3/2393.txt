"Even though allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building sounds like a good idea, it wasnt. There are many obstacles that prevent it from happening. With ""a @DATE1 ft dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). Also one of the greatest obstacles as the violent winds that constantly change due to violent air currents. Also, the dirigible would be dangling above pedestrians on the street which isn't safe. The biggest obstacle was the fact that it's illegal for airships of flying low over urban areas which would also make it illegal for the dirigible to tie itself up to the building or even get close to it. This sounds like a great idea and a great way to get more tourists, but there are too many obstacles to make it realistic."
