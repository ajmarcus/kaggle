"In the memoir I think the mood the author creates is love for family. In paragraph @ORGANIZATION1 explains that family has nothing to do with being a ""blood"" relative. He means that you don't have to be related to someone to consider them family. In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso says that so many extended family members come in and out of his house all the time and they are always treated lovingly. I think that the fact that Rodriguez's parents brought in so many people to their home is inspiring because it really does show the love and warmth the family has to bring in refugees from places other than america, plus their family!"
