"Home is where the heart is, many of said this and many more have meant it. In the non-fictional memoir by @PERSON1 talks about the importance of family. Narciso pats many moods into the story and describes them with such grace. ""Friends and celebrations both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" (paragraf @NUM1) This gives a sence that for him home was the safest and happiest place for him to be. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open the the many people we considered family."" (paragraf @NUM2) This gives off the mood that his home was a very careing place and that anyone that they loved was cared for. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family'."" (paragraf @NUM3). This sets the mood that he was never really alone that he had people with him at all times that cared and loved for him like he loved for them. ""My parents turned this simple house into a home."" (paragraf @NUM3)"
