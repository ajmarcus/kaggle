"The features of the setting had greatly impacted the cyclist. The heat, animals, and terrain had slowed him down throught his journey. The heat had slowed him down because he didnt have enough water to keep his boby moving normaly, and he said he had slowed him down because he had to sneak around it so it wouldnt bite him. The hills had affected the cyclist because it takes a lot of energy to go up there, when he said he couldnt see anything in sight."
