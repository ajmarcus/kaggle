"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a very happy, loving, content mood. This mood is created by Narciso talking about what a great and happy life his parents made for him. For example in paragraph @NUM1 he says ""the congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. It just sounds so happy and loving to me. He also says things like ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extened a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need. Thats another example of the loving happy mood in this memoir because hes talking about how people were so helpful and gracious to anyone in need and it makes me feel so happy that people are like that. I really enjoyed reading this memoir because it was all about peoples love toward eachother which set a very happy, light-hearted mood for me."
