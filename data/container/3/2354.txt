"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the first problems they faced was not being able to land. ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York was the lack of suitable landing area."" (@CAPS1 6). This was a major problem because they had nowhere to land this object; this cannot modernize their traveling.Another problem that the builders faced was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This caused a problem because how were dirigibles from other countries visit us if they caused a threat to the safety of the people. They were not going to take that risk.A third problem was nature and the weather. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) The blimps had a very unsteady landing The winds would thrash them around. This was very unsafe @CAPS5 thats why it became an obsticale for the builders."
