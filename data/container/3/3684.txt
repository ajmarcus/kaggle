"In the text, the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. For example, the text states, “There was no one in sight, not a building, or structure of any kind.” This made the cyclist very lonely and they started to lose hope of finding water. Secondly, the text stated, ""In an ironic twist the building abandoned years easlier, by the looks of it-had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory” This made the cyclist lose more hope, after he thought the building would have people in it and he got excited. Lastly, the text states, “GRAPE AND @CAPS1’S FISH CAMP” The sight of this building gave the cyclist hope and happiness for finding a place to get a drink. The setting’s features greatly affect the cyclist's feelings."
