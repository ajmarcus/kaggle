"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on its mooring mast. The first obstacle they had was the extreme winds. The winds were constantly shifting, so the dirigibles would be violently blowing through the air. Another obstacle was that the foreign dirigibles used hydrogen, instead of helium, which is extremely flammable. The last obstacle the builders faced was the law that it did not allow airships to fly too low over urban areas. The builders of the Empire State Building dealt with a number of reasons when they attempted to dock dirigibles on the building's mast."
