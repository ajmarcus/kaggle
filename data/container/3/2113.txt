"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles, while trying to build a dock for dirigible. One problem was safety. While American dirigibles used helium, other countries filled their dirigibles with highly flamable helium. If a dirigible were to ignite in a heavily populated area like New York City, the result would be deadly. Nature also caused problems with the mooring mast. The winds above the building were too strong and ever-changing, and could potentially destroy the dirigibles. Finally, federal laws stated that an air craft could not dock that close to a building. These three factors made it impossible for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building."
