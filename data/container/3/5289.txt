"“Do not exceed posted speed limit”, is a short story about a man who is bicycling through Yosemite and he asks some elderly men for direction and they lead him in this “old” shortcut that takes him through tough terrain and extreme famine. The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways throughout the story for example when the bicyclist came to a deserted area he said “there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind”. By this time he was malnourished & in need of water this extreme thrist also reselted in him passing an abandoned Welch’s grape juice factory with an advertisement with a young boy pouring a fresh glass of juice in his mouth. He says “In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building,”, then he goes into detail about the building, this mood & feeling by this time was tired and worn out and the advertisement didn’t help the situation at all. The authors mood did change with the setting and before it got better it was worse."
