"Determined, new beginning, symbolism – each are reasons why I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph. She finds new hope after buying the plant, and is newly determined to pass the test that she writes about. As she sees the geese flying overhead, she realizes what determination they must have and vows to do better on the test next year. With the new flower, she feels like shes starting over so that she’s able to pass this test that seems important to her. When the author write, “and the geese will return and this hibiscus in budding, then I will take that test again,” it shows symbolism. By telling about the flower blooming new buds, it symbolizes that Saeng wanted to turn over a new leaf of some sort. Determined, new beginning, symbolism – each are reasons why I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph."
