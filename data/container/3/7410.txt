"The mood created by the author was one of happiness, love, and caring. Not only does it show in his style, but the author also gives details that really create the vibe. In paragraph @NUM1, the author describes the food as ""rich culinary skills and love of cooking,"" and the music as ""passionate Cuban music...mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This creates a homely affect to the scene, along with the paragraph about the many ""family members"" that came over for meals. The author describes this and explains that this was all possible, despite the nation's racism, because his parents worked hard to get where they were for the faith that their children would have a better life than they had. With all of the details, the author creates a loving, cultural affect can only be found with great family and friends."
