"In the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 builders must faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow the dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. In paragraph @NUM1 of the excerpt it states, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The stress of the wind and dirigible's weight would have to be transmitted to the foundation of the building, about eleven hundred feet below. In paragraph @NUM2 of the excerpt it states, ""most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, and the hydrogen is highly flammable."" If another disaster happened like the Hindenburg (which was destroyed by fire) in an area heavily populated like New York, above a large building with many people, it would be a thousand times worse. The winds above the Empire State Building were constantly changing because of violent air currents. This left the designers to deal with the problem of a dirigible swinging around the mooring mast. In the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @ORGANIZATION2 the builders faced so many obstacles that they eventually abandoned the project."
