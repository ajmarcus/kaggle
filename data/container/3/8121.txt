"I think the mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir is that he is proud and grateful. One way he shows he is grateful is by telling the readers how his parents sacrificed themselves to give him a better life. He says: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Which shows that in addition to being grateful to them for sacrificing themselves, he is grateful for all the love and care they gave to him as he grew up. Narciso Rodriguez shows he is proud by saying ""my Mother and father had come to this country with such courage I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done"". This shows Narciso Rodriguez is proud to have parents that are strong and brave and willing to leave ""behind their families, friends, and careers, and the country they loved"" all for him. So I hope you now see how Narciso Rodriguez's memoir creates a mood that reflects how he is proud of and grateful to his parents."
