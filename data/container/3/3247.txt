". The Empire State Building during it's construction was being planned to serve as a mast, in which dirigibles could be attached to. The builders of the building did not realize the severity of the obstacles preventing them from safely accomplishing this feat. Most of the problems presented for the most part were concerning safety. Due to safety issues the mast was considered to lucrative and idea, and posed too much of a danger. There were simply too many possible opportunities for something to go wrong. One of these issues was that dirigibles contain dangerous flamable gases, that if something went wrong a flamming dirible coming down on down town New York City would cause major damage. Another obstacle preventing this idea from becoming reality was that the dirible tethered to the mast would be ""constantly shifting due to the violent air currents (para @NUM1). Another reason why it couldn't be done ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (para @NUM2). All of the problems that could not be solved plausibly were the reason why, the mast was unrealistic."
