"The setting acts as a catylist in this story. It is the aspect of the story that is always challenging the character untill the very end. In the story it says ÒFlat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This is showing that the terrain is opposing him. Also in the story it says ÒThe speed limit was 55. I was doing a water depleted 12 mph. Sometimes life can be so cool.Ó This is not only showing how much the elements are owning him it also shows how is risle he is, and how satiricle life can be. The ultimate @CAPS1 in this story is when he stumbels across the welches grape juice factory and there was a piture of a boy ""pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth.Ó No matter where the cycalist goes he is alway trying to overcome the elements."
