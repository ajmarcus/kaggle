"The mood created by the @CAPS1 in this memoir is mostly grateful through the memoir. It's grateful well because the @CAPS1 talks about how thankful he is that he has such loving Parents who risked sacrifised their Jobs, and @CAPS2 everything they had back in Cuba to go to the united states where they did not know the language, had no money, and at the moment no shelter. I know it is grateful because the @CAPS1 clearly says ""I will always be grateful to my Parents For their love and Sacrifice."" this pin-points the mood as well as throughout the excerpt the @CAPS1 speaks about his gratefulness to his Parents. In conclusion the mood to wards the article I think happens to be grateful."
