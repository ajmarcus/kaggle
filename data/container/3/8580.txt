"The main mood through out this entire excerpt from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is one of thanks. Through out the excerpt, @ORGANIZATION1 about and explains about how his parents struggled in the US for their children. In his house, as it is said in paragraph @NUM1, ""My young parents created our traditional cuban home"" @CAPS1 loved everything about that home. Also his family. Not blood relatives just family. His family was made up of the entire community in a time, as discribed in paragraph @NUM2, ""When overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the @LOCATION1."" @CAPS1 is most thankful of his parents. In paragraph @NUM3 it discribes ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life... They struggled bothe personally and financially... My parents had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved"" His parents gave up everything for his current life and Narciso is forever greatful."
