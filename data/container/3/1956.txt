"I've been to the Empire state building before, right up to the top. The top was not opened, but several windows were, and our thing that still stays with me is how amazingly windy it is up there. Trying to park a blimp on top of the building would be like trying to park a car in a flood, impossible I was waiting for that factor to come up the whole story, and it finally did. ""The winds on top of the building work constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) In addition to parking the blimp, the passengers would have to get off on a swaying gang-plank, which would not be too fun. Another problem they faced was the law. There was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) I would think that before spending @MONEY1 on an already unrealistic project, they would at least have made sure they were cleared law-wise. When I read this essay, it seems the project was doomed from the start."
