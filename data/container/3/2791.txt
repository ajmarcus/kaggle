"There were three main @CAPS1 that the builders faced: safety, Nature and THE LAW.The first obstacle that they faced was safety. Many blimps used Hydrogen instead of Helium. While Helium is a @CAPS2 gas, Hydrogen is a @CAPS3 which are combustible.The second obstacle they faced was Nature. The @CAPS4 winds blew the Blimps off target and because they weren't aero dynamic, it was @CAPS5 to manever them.The third obstacle was a law that stated that Blimps can't fly too low, so if the other @CAPS1 didn't exist, it would still be illegal.IN conclusion, they Should Have built a @CAPS6 because @CAPS7 are simply better than Blimps."
