"The mood that author has created in this memoir was a happy feeling because this is proud of his culture. He loves his parents and loves that house that they turned into a home. The author exsplains how his life begain in new jersey and how proud of his parents he was and that he looks up to them and plans on carryinging out the culture and triditions that his family had so that's what makes me think that the mood of that the author sets was happiness and fullness of this familys life, and as I read this passage I was glad and happy for him that he admires his family that much and how happy his life was."
