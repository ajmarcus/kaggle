"During Narciso's life, growing up in a small house doesn't matter when you're surrounded by people you love. The author created the mood of happiness, love, achievement, and being proud. Narciso was very proud of his cuban heratige, as well has his brave parents, that created a beautiful home and life for him. The mood was also happy because it's a very happy story. There is love and achievement in the mood as well because Narciso loved his friends, family, neighborhood, home and childhood. The achievement was of his parents comming over to @LOCATION1 and starting a better life. Anyone would be happy with a childhood like that because being surrounded by the ones you love and being proud of you and your family is what is important."
