"The mood in this memoir is very strong. Sometimes the mood is sad, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially...The barriers to work were strong and high, And my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved."" In this memoir the mood is also happy at times, ""Growing up in this enviorment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" The author, Narciso Rodriguez creates many moods in his memoir, he creates happy, sad, and many more, but his memoir ends happily, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."""
