"In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, he undoubtedly creates a mood of happyness and love, love for his family and friends. His definition of family is different from other people's definitions, but many people would agree with his definition. He calls family not only blood relatives, but the love and friendship that people have for eachother. By creating a mood of love and happyness draws the reader into a cultural story and how his life was affected by that of his parents, and his family. When he describes the food, the laughter, the neighbors, the kitchen, and the house, it all feels very warm and feels like a place someone would love to be at. Because he talks about things people want to hear, he accomplishes a great feeling of warmth and being happy throughout the reading."
