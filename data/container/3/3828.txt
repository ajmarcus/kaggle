"Some features of the setting affect the cyclist on his journey to Yosemite. Starting off, ad men who havent seen the changes this world made for about a decade, gave the cyclist a bad start. If the cyclist wouldnt have gotten the shortcut information, he wouldnt have been without water in abandoned towns. When the cyclist arrives at some rusty pumps, he decided to check it out and see if there is any water. The water was really not and it tasted like battery acid. The cyclist decided to keep going, even though he was running out of water. When he came to a snake in the rode, he had to get by his dehydrated state. I would imagine this would be dangerous if you couldnt focus well in the road. He then came upon @ORGANIZATION1 that has do and abandoned. He obviously couldnt get any water there seeing as how bad of condition the building was. When the cyclist had no water, he became dehydrated and unfortunately there were no stops for water on his journey that day to Yosemite."
