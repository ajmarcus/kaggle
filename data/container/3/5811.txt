"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she realizes her connection to the hibiscus plant. All through the story Saeng thinks about native plants she’s seen before are now in @LOCATION1. She sees how they’re adapted to life there, like in the way the hibiscus can survive the winter. Saeng realizes that she also must adapt in her new home. She doesn’t necessarily need to adapt to survive, but to be successful. She vows that in the spring, when the hibiscus is budding (restarting its growth cycle) she will restart too and retake the test."
