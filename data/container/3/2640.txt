"What the builders are faced with while trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, one of them was nature. The winds at the top of the building were always shifting cause of violent air currents. Even if they were able to tie the front of the dirigibles to the building the cable that is holding it will cause pressure to the building. They only way you could have the building not have pressure on it was to modify the building so it can get stronger that would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Even if they were able to get around all these obstacles there is a law against airships flying to low over the city. So either way it would not have been able to happen."
