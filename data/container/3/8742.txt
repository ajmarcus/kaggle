"After reading the selection ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by @PERSON1 I have decided the as a child @PERSON1 seemed to have a very fun life. Also the memoir seemed to have a good mood to it. One thing that made the mood good with all the talking about parties. I like parties and thinking about parties during @CAPS1 makes it a little less @CAPS2 racking. Another thing that sets a good mood is a talk about how Narciso's parents are always upbeat and ready for any thing. The final thing that makes the selection have a very good mood is how Narciso talks about all his family and friends. When I think of good memories of my family and friends it always brings a smile to my face. Overall this memoir made me feel good and brightened my day."
