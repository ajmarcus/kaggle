"The author does an excellent job for creating many moods in this memoir. One of the moods, is love. Love is a mood in this memoir because @PERSON1's parents took ten people who needed somewhere to stay, because they know that those people would do the same thing for them. Another example of love is when @PERSON1 says in paragraph @NUM1, ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" The memoir also makes one feel very grateful for what they have, which, is another mood. It does this by having the author point out how little his house was, and how his parents did everything they could to give them a better life. It really makes one look back, and see how much their parents have done for them."
