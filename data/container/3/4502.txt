"I think the features in the setting of the story ""Do not exceed the speed limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, highly affect the cyclist. Some implied a information would be that it is very hot out, and the people in towns didn't help him. I know that it is not because the text says,""somewhere in the neighbourhood of @NUM1 degrees.""

I can tell the people in towns didn't help him because the text says, ""Never accept travel advice from collection of old-timers who havent left the confines of their porches since carter was in office. ""This shows that the people in towns didnn't help him. Some expressed information in this text would be that there is a rough road, and a shake was in his way. I know this is expressed because it tells you right in the text. ""Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit. ""This comes right out and tells you there is a rough road. You know there is a shake because the text says, ""and rediculously large snake blocked the majority of the road. I think there are many implied t expressed information in the story""do not exceed the speed limit. "
