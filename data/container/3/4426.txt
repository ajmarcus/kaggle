"At first the cyclist feels fine, he gets a little bit discouraged, but basically hes fine. The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them (@CAPS1). He feels relaxed, because he is at home with the water and the pine trees. They give him a sense of comfort. He thinks that after the first ""tree"" not being that much of anything, the others will be better. He knows that he has it in him to make it, but he doesnt know yet that he will have to travel a long way to get water. When he sees the sign, It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. he knows that things are going to get rough, because the speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. At that point he starts to get worried, because he is out there more alone, and he realizes that he doesnt have water. As he runs out of water, the landscape, and his surroundings, start to get drier and drier. He states, tumble weeds crossed my path. The landscape seems to get more threatening too, a ridiculously large shake. The landscape changes with the state of water."
