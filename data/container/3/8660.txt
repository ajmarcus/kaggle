"The are many strong feelings in the memoir but @CAPS1 is the most important one. In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", Narciso Rodriguez talks about all of the sacrifices and Love in his house hold and how @CAPS2 is forever great full for his parents selflessness. ""Love of cooking that is still with me today (and for what I am extreemly greatfull)"" is what Rodriguez says @CAPS2 appricietes. @CAPS2 is also appriciative for the way @CAPS2 grew up and how his parents taught him that ""family had nothing to do with being a blood realetive."" @CAPS2 is so appricietive that @CAPS2 tells his parents constantly that @CAPS2 ""will always be greatfull to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author excpetially ex presses the mood of @CAPS1 in the line, ""I will never ferget that house or its gracious naighbor hood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Rodriguez is forever appriciative to his parents and their strong desitions that made him the person @CAPS2 is today."
