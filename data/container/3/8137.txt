"In this memoir the author creates a mood which- for me, sucked me into this memoir. I think Narciso Rodriguez created a ""home sweet home"" mood. I say this because when he says, ""within it walls, my young parents created our tradition cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" it reminds me of my family and how my family loves cooking puerto @CAPS1 food. The smell is like, ""your home"". In my home everyone's execpted and even if you're not realated. Narciso also says this in his memoir. also.Narciso is very grateful in his memoir because his parents immigrated to have a better life. this creates a loving and family mood. Narciso says, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many thing I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. Now that they've immigrated Narciso Rodriguez will never forget his childhood home. There are many moods in this memoir."
