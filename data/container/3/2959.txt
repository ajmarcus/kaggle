"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the reader learns about many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The most important obstacle to overcome was safety. The United States used hydrogen rather than helium to power the dirigibles. As said in @CAPS2 @NUM1, after the Hindenburg was destroyed, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how catastrophic the accident would be if it was over a densely populated area such as New York. Another obstacle faced was the brutal winds which occur at such a high altitude. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS2 @NUM2). The final obstacle the builders faced was that there was a law, ""against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@CAPS2 @NUM3) which made it illegal to tie a dirigible to a building. In conclusion the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles yet in the end, ""Dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes"" (@CAPS2 @NUM4)"
