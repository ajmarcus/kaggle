"The mood created in the memoir is happiness and gratitude. Narciso is grateful of his parents for moving to @LOCATION1, and still give him warm happy feeling of a house in Cuba. His parents passed down their culture to him and he is happy that they did. Narciso is glad to have lived in the home that they did, and all the opertunities that he had as a child. He is grateful that his family always got together and had a feast with cuban music, activities, and food. His parents gave up their jobs and had to Start their lives over entirely. Narciso is also grateful that he learned the real definition of ""family"". He is also very grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice."
