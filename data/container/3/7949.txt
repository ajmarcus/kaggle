"The mood created by the author in the memoir was loving and caringness. Repeatedly throughout the memoir, the speaker Narciso Rodriguez which show what his family did after migrating from their native country, Cuba to their love. As said his parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family, knowing that they would do the same for them. They cared for their children's future, by leaving their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. All though ""they struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" they had to do what they thought was best for their children. Their simple house was the best place for them to be together as a family. ""The warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love"". This memoir made me connect this family to mines how similar it is. Without love it isn't a family, thats why at the end of the word ""family"" the i, l, y stand for ""i love you."""
