"The setting puts a great deal of stress on the cyclist. The biggest issue he faces is the weather. He is a cyclist traveling through the high deserts of @LOCATION1 in June. He had been riding his bike all day and he was soon going to run out of water. Just when he thought he could drink more water, he drank water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. The weather being so hot and humid, did not help the cyclist throughout his journey. Another factor of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills, is a main problem the cyclist faced. These changes in terrain played into the fact that the weather did not cooperate. The hills made the cyclist work harder therefore use more energy. Luckily the terrain had a positive affect on the cyclist as well. The stones he found on the ground, helped keep his mind off the thirst. There were many factors of the setting that negatively and positively affected the cyclist throughout his adventure."
