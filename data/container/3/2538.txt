"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First it was illegal to have an aircraft flying too close to a city ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". Another obstacle was the buildings structure if the blimp had docked there would be stress on the building ""would add stress to the buildings Frame"". The last obstacle was the wind would push the blimp around every which way when docked on the tower ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"""
