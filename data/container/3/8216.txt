"The mood created by the author (narciso Rodriguez) in the memoir was that he was grateful/appreciative for his life, and also happy with his life. Through out this memoir I think he has realized and is explaining what family really is and that he is grateful for having one. You'll figure this out when you read this because he states, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relative."" what he also says that proves his mood was grateful is, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 with all this being said I believe thats what his mood was through out the memoir."
