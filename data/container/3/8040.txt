"The mood created by the author was happy, The love Of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (Which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. I will always be greatful to my parent, for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could ever done. They @CAPS1 me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life. My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life. The author's mood is happy and grateful of there parents to give the author a better life, and leaving what's behind."
