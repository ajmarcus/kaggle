"While constructing the Empire State Building, the builders were faced with many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there One such obstacle that the builders had overcome was the law that prevented airships (i.e. plains or dirigibles) from flying too low over urban areas. In paragraph @NUM1, we learn that ""[this law] would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Another obstacle the building crew of the Empire State Building was faced with when constructing the mooring mast was nature itself. Because of the violent wind currents near the top of the building, the way the wind blew constantly changed, causing a great difficulty for any dirigible to connect to the mast properly. In paragraph @NUM2, we are told about how if it were possible to connect the mast to a dirigible that the back would swing. ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the Street, was neither practical or safe."" Because there were too many obstacles with not enough safe options, the mooring mast project were shut down; proving that during its construction its builders were faced with too many obstacles."
