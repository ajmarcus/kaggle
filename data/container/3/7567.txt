"The @CAPS1 is trying to make the reader understand Narciso Rodriguez feelings by describing how little Narciso had grown up with and how hard it must have been for him to live in that type of enviroment and home. for example ""In 1961 i was born into this simple house, situated two-family, blond brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey."" This quote @CAPS4 how even from his early days being as a child Narciso was still living in poor enviroments and did not have much at all. The @CAPS1 @CAPS4 the unhappiness in the Rodriguez family and how they are struggling to make everything better @CAPS2 the end of the memior the @CAPS1 @CAPS4 the happiness and how proud the family is because they are now doing a lot better then they were before. for example ""I will never forget how my parents turned a house into a home"". Again this grate @CAPS4 how proud they are to be living in a much better place and enviroment, And had to struggle to get where they are now"
