"The author created a mood of warmth and happiness. By talking about his parents cultural cooking and music gave a feeling of home. His parents graciously taking in people when things weren't going well for them, created a mood of the unity and friendship, along with the love for extended family. The author also creates a grateful mood through his parents' love and sacrifice, as well as there struggle to make there lives better. This also showed perseverance because Narciso's parents couldn't even speak english but they made it through that and created a wonderful life for their family."
