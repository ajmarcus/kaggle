"The mood created by the @PERSON1 in the memoir was to show how happy it was for Narciso Rodriguez growing up. ""here, The innocence of childhood, The congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the back drop to life in our warm home"" and when the @PERSON1 says ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relitive."" as you can see the mood of the story is warm and tells us about how he had a good Childhood"
