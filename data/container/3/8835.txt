"The mood in this memoir created by the author, was very peaceful and extremely loving. It was also a big thank you to his parents for everything they did for him. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and Sacrifice."" The author is trying to get his point (of gratefulness) across to, not only the reader, but everyone in his life, but it seems that at some point he's lost for words. ""@CAPS1 often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the Spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The way the author explains everything puts you in the same mood is him. He seemed to feel the same peaceful, yet loving, and grateful mood flow over you as well. This is an amazing piece of work."
