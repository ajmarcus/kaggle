"Setting in Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit really determines how the story turns out. The setting was in deserted areas, the desert, and even roadways. In the desert, there is no water making the cyclist become dehydrated. without water, he thought he was going to die. In the road areas, the speed limits was extremly high fifty-five miles per hour. This would not be good since he is doing   a water-depleting @NUM1. When he finds areas that are abandoned, these are water pumps, but the liquid that comes out @MONTH1 be water, but it tastes like battery acid. Setting can affect alot in the story. Without this setting, the story would be alot different than it is now."
