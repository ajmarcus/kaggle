The builders had many obstacles to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. During the @DATE1's dirigibles were a big thing in transportation. The problem was that there wasn't many landing areas for the dirigibles to land because they were so big. So Al Smith came up with an idea to make a landing dock on top of the Empire State Building for the dirigibles. The government had to go over Al Smith's plan to make sure it was safe and would work. Al Smith's plan was to have the dirigibles hang onto the building by a single tether wire. It wouldnt be alowed because the dirigibles hanging from the wire would cause to much stress to the building. It was also not possible to have dirigibles to land on the Empire State building because the hydrogen and the dirigibles would be a safety hazard. The hydrogen in the dirigibles could catch on fire and burn the Empire State building down.
