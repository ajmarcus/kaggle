"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a positive one. The author tells how his parents immigrated from Cuba in 1956 and how he was born in 1961. He never said one negative thing about his life growing up in Newark, New Jersey. He mentioned how his parents had a love for cooking and that love was passed down to him. He said that he was grateful for that. He also mentioned that, along with the cooking, was Passionate Cuban music. He described his neighborhood as being made up of ""all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" As a final sentence, the author stated how we ""will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."""
