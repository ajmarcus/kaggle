"While the cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park he listen to some old  men who gave him directions for a shortcut.When he began his trip everything was fine.But then he found that along the “shortcut” there was no building.By the time he figured out that the old men were mistake he had almost run out of water.There was nothing around that he could drink.He was getting very thirsty.The fact that he was in the deserts of California in June didn’t make his task any easier.About halfway through his ride he ran into rolling hills, which made his trip even harder.Towards the end he found a building and he used all of his strength to get to it just to find that it was an abandoned juice factory.This made going without water much harder as well as he gazed at the picture of the boy who was drinking juice.In the end he finally make it to a pait shop where he guzzled all the water he possibly could"
