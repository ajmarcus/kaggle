"The  builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A @NUM1 foot dirigible would add stress to the buildings Frame. Most dirigibles out of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable. The acciedent of Hindenburg also raised alarm. Hindenburg set fire on Lakehurst in New Jersey. This showed the builders how much worse the acciedent could have been if it had happened over a densely populated area, such as New York. Another factor were the wind currents. They were constantly @CAPS1. This would cause the back Of the dirigible to sway and move about. There was also a preexisting law stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. These are some of the reasons obstacles the builders fased in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building."
