"During the construction of the empire state building builders faced many obstacles with attempting to allow a dirigible to dock there. These problems consisted of safety and practical isshues. one safety isshue was that most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. hydrogen was more flammable than helium. This led to the hindenburg a german airship to be destroyed by fire. ""most dirigibels from outside the United States uses hydrogen rather that helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The builders also had practical isshues such as it was illegal to fly a airship to low low over a city. ""the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. This made it illegal for a ship to even tie up to the building."" These obstacles stopped the hops landing on a building."
