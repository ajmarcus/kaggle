"Many problems faced the construction workers of the Empire State building, @CAPS1 in allowing dirigibles to dock. To begin, construction for dirigibles on the Empire State building was dangerouse. Dirigibles couldn't do many basic things to dock at the building. For example ""dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building."" (@CAPS2 @NUM1) Mooring was impossible because it was against ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@CAPS2 @NUM1) This made it illegal for a ship to tie to the Empire State Building. Also, the greatest threat to dirigibles was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS2 @NUM3) Because of this and be fact that construction on such a high building at the time was unpractable, dirigibles never touched the Empire State building. So to close, the difficulty of building dirigible landing gear and of landing dirigibles ultimately ened the Empire State Building docks."
