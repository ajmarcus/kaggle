"In the excerpt ""The @CAPS1 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted the builders faced many obstacles. They were trying to get Dirigibles to land on the empire state building. They faced many problems while trying to accomplish this feat. If they were going to have Dirigibles land atop the building they would have to add floors to the building. Another one is ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation."" Which means they would have to waste even more money. Then something they found out later is they couldn't even do this, in the first place due to legal matters. If they did that then they would be getting themselves in trouble with the legal system. Once they realized that I think that they realize the project was a failure and told the world ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postone too a later date the final installation of the landing gear."""
