"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author concludes the story with the lines “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The reason that the author concludes the test with these lines is because she is re-establing the symbolism of the plant. In the text it said that the plant budds in the spring, once it has time to grow and adapt to the new enviroment. Just as the plant needed that time so did the main character Saeng. She just moved from Vietnam and failed her drivers test. Saeng is very unsure of her new culture. For example she likes bitter melon it says. “But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself much prefered it to a Big Mac.” She appears to think she is misunderstood an no one likes her, but just as the plant will adapt to this new life so will she."
