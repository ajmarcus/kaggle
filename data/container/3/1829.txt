"There were many problems with allowing dirigibles to land on top of the Empire State Building. When designing the mast they realized that with the weight of the dirible, the buildings frame would have stress. (paragraph @NUM1) They also noticed that the diribles from other countries used hydrogen and not helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable. (paragraph @NUM2). A factor of building the mast that was out of the builders control was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting. (paragraph @NUM3). Law was also a problem when wanting to construct the mast. There was a law against airships flying to low over urban areas. (paragraph @NUM4). With the factors of weight, gas, nature, and law the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles."
