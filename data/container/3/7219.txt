"The mood of ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is @CAPS1 much the same throughout the whole excerpt.   In the story, the mood the whole time is calm and relaxed. Narciso talks about his family and how much he loves them and what they have done for him. It says in the story ""Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" @CAPS1 much throughout the story, this is the mood.       Another mood created by the author is gratefulness and thankfulness. Narciso is thankful to his parents selflessness. In the story, Narciso says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The way he talks about his parents ends up making the reader thankful too.     Narciso Rodriguez creates happy moods for us by the way he writes with love about his family and how he cares so much about what they did for him."
