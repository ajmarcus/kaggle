"The mood in the memoir is gratefulness and happiness. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful."" This shows how @CAPS1 thanks his parents for loving cooking. Skill that cooking and his eternal gratitude. Also, in paragraph @NUM2 it says ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 is happy that @CAPS1 grew up in @LOCATION1 and how grateful @CAPS1 is to them for passing down their traits and loves to him and all their hard work."
