"When the empire state building was constructed it ran into many problems attempting to dock dirigibles there. One problem they ran into is that most overseas blimps were still filled with hydrogen, which is a very flammable gas. The constructors did not want to re-create the Hindenburg accident over a densely populated area such as New York City. The greatest obstacle to the mooring mast was nature itself. The wind currents atop the building were violent and always shifting. Docking a Dirigible there in those conditions would cause it to swivel around the building and become unsafe for passengers. That is why the mooring mast never fulfilled it's purpose."
