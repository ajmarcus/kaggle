"The setting of the essay didnt really help the author at all on his journey. There were not many structures on the way. Either that, of the towns said to be, a ghost town. @CAPS1 this couldnt have reassured the author that things were going his way. It also was very hot during his journey. The author says he is traveling through the deserts of California in June. Deserts are very hot places and June is during summer which is the hottest month so it had to have been extremely hot and humid. @CAPS1 all this must have taken a toll because he never really saw anything reassuring until the last town he reached with the bait store. So the setting definitely had to have affected his confidence and his energy levels."
