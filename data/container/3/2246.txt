"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lsted, it describes many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to face in order to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they had to face was the constant change in nature and how it could affect the dirigibles. The dirigibles would ""swivel around"" because of the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This could put pedestrians on the street in danger because the ship is on top moving and could be unstable. Another obstacle is safety. Outside the United States the dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Other countries ships could set on fire in the United States and put people in danger. Also the fact that the loading dock was more than 1,250 feet and loading off could be unstable because of the winds. The last obstacle faced was the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". Therefore it was illegal to get the dirigibles close enough to the buildings safely. All these obstacles faced made the workers and planners realize this idea could not be achieved without harming anyone or putting people in danger."
