"The obstacles which the builders of the empire state building faced to allow dirigibles to dock there were numerous for this project. The first problem was that, other dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen. Hydrogen is a much more flammable substance than helium, which is what dirigibles in the United States used. The owners didn't want anything to occur similar to the German dirigible the Hindenburg, which would be worse in downtown New York instead of Lakehurst, New Jersey. Another practical reason why dirigibles faced problems docking at the Empire State building was that an existing law prevented dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas. For example a @ORGANIZATION1 dirigible named the Los Angeles, could not get close enough to tie up due to forceful winds. These problems go to show that owners of the Empire State building faced numerous obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there."
