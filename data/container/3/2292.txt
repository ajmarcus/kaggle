"The obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were a lot. They had trouble with the area thing where they were going to do their job. ""The one obstacle in their expanded used in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" Another obtacle that they had was with the mooring mast. ""the greatest obstacle to the successful of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Then there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. and if they did it it would become illegal to the ship that pass tie up to the building or even approach the area."
