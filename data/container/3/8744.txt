"The mood the author created in the memoir is... to show how to be grateful. Appreciate what you have in life. Like in the memoir Narciso lives in a apartment with one bed room. But he loved it there was and is good memories. Narciso quotes on @CAPS1 @NUM1.... ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thank them repedatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon, me at such an early age and demonstration of how important family and friends are.                                                                                                                                                                                           That quote told every thing the whole mood of the story and the very last sentence                                                      ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."
