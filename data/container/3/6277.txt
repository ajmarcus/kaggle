"I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show how as the plant will grow, so will Saeng . After failing the drivers test, saeng goes to the greenhouse and finds the Hibiscus plant which reminds her of her true home back in Vietnam when they had similar plants. The plant then makes her think about all the memories and she is comforted by them even though she is said. She uses this plant as a tool for comfort  to  help  her think about when she is from and all the good memories to help raise her spirits higher. So to boost her confidence  she decides to plant it. “The “winter hibiscus” was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around. “Then she sees geese flying in the sky which  is kind of a symbol do that day, something to rembember  it by, so the next year.” When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” She will take the test again. These things bring back good memories which help to make her stronger."
