"In the memoir. from ""Home The Blueprints of Our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez there is a certain mood created. I believe Rodriguez creates a ""thankful"" mood in his memoir. In the memoir Narciso talks about how his parents had successful lives in Cuba but came to @LOCATION1 so Narciso can have a better life. Narciso even said, ""they came selflessly, as many imigrants do, to give there children a better life..."" @CAPS1 was thankful that his parents sacrificed everything for him. Rodriguez said, ""... even though it meant leaving behind their families, frineds and careers in the country they loved""Rodriguez was also thankful for his parents turning ""this simple house into a home."" His parents made his house feel warm and cozy. @CAPS1 leared the real definition of family living in this simple house.At the end, @CAPS1 said @CAPS1 could never be able to thank his parents for what they sacrificed for him"
