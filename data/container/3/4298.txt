"The different settings in the essay/ writing affect the cyclist because of how old and hopeless they look. I think this because when the cyclist stops at the first town, hes looking around expecting to find a quaint, bustling little place, but instead he finds these abandoned, decimated old houses. And if you yourself can picture being in his situation, then you can imagine how discouraging and almost frightening that must be. As the cyclist continues for a few more miles, hes becoming slowly dehydrated, and finally sees a building. At first, he thinks this building is a mirage; he was wrong, but for him in this situation it was worse- an old juice factory, right when point you kind of get the feeling that every things turning against you and that theres no hope left. But when he finds the fishing camp, his entire perspective of things changes, and he just feels so thankful to have been saved."
