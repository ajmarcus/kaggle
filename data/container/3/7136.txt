"The mood in this memoir is heartwarming.This memoir is heartwarming because it's about her parents came from Cuba to the @CAPS1. S. It's nice how the blonde-brick house was better but still the same as the house their parents lived in. The Cuban music filled the air of the house like it was a house in Cuba. A house isn't a house untill you call it a home. That family has made that their home forever. Even though their family can't come down till 1970 they too will have a place to call home like Narciso Rodriguez did. Like he said in the memoir ""I will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home""."
