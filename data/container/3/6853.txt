"The author concludes the story with Saeng telling herself shell take the test again because it draws together the overall theme and major actions of the story. The theme of the story is that you can get used to a new environment by finding beauty in it and similarities to your old home. Saeng says that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now like the geese. And when shes in the greenhouse the plants draw her back into memories of Vietnam and her grandmother. Saeng was having a hard time adjusting to new things after moving to @LOCATION2, but she was determined to overcome the difficulties just like she had overcome the differences between the @LOCATION3 and Vietnam. I think the author concluded the story by talking about the geese and the hibiscus and re.taking the test because it demonstrates all the ways that Saeng is adjusting to her new life and shows her and the reader that she can overcome new things. She vows to herself that she can do it, and fereshadows her future and sucess and adaptation to an @CAPS1 lifestyle.  "
