"Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigible to dock was that the winds at that height were alway changing and difficult to land a dirigible with. Also the dirigible are highly flammable because the used hydrogen rather than helium. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The project was a bad idea from the start. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" They even attempt to try it before they gave up. ""In December 1930, the @ORGANIZATION2 dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but couldn't get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds.""  It just wasn't made do that job so it wouldn't work."
