"The builders of the Empire State Building face many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced was the safety issue. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, most foreign dirigibles used the flammable element hydrogen rather than helium. A fire would be very deadly in a highly populated area like downtown New York. Another obstacle the builders were faced with was the wind. In paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the un-tied back of the dirigible to thrash around and even ""swivel around the mooring mast."" When a dirigible is moored in open fields, they can be weighted down with lead weights. Doing this in open air above the Empire State building would be un-safe due to pedestrians below. The final obstacle builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In paragraph @NUM3, it says, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" This is why the mooring mast for dirigibles of the Empire State building never served its purpose."
