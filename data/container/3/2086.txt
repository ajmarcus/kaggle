"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, their were many obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One reason was the safety. Paragraph @NUM1 from the excerpts explains that, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" It shows us that if an accident was to happen on the mast above a densely populated area like downtown New York, then the accident could get ugly. Another reason why was nature itself. Paragraph @NUM2 explains that the, ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This was another safety issue because the dirigibles would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street. A third obstacle was that there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. As you can see those were some obstacles builders faced."
