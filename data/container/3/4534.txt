"The journey of a solo cyclist is a lonely one. The cyclist in Do not exceed posted speed limit had a particulaly hard journey, as made even worse by the setting. His main opponent in the battle of staying alive was the heat. In the California deserts as a day in June. It was no surprise that the sun would be heating down particularlly harder than it would at another place anytime. Also, as the terrain became hillier, his journey became even harder. There is nothing hard about biking in a flat straight line. But constantly peadling yourself up steep hills and around winding roads is no picnic. Just like the buildings around him, the cyclists water deteriorated as did his state of mind as his trip which started out very joyful became increasingly more mardid. It didnt really matter, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean. This cyclist was fighting against strong forces of nature."
