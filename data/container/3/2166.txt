"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. For example the building had to be reframed because its original frame could not support the weight of a dirigible on top it. Also the materials inside dirigibles are highly flammable so an accident above an urban area thats highly popuated would have been costly/fatal. Another obstacle was the wind, since the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents the dirigible would be swiveling around and unstable, thus making the idea for docking dirigibles on top of the empire state building unpractical and unsafe."
