"In the excerpt ""The Mooring @CAPS1"", by: Marcia Amidon @CAPS2 the builders of the empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose due to many reasons and many obstacles. One of those many reason was that most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Furthermore the biggest obstacle to the sucessful use of morning mast was nature itself. Due to the reason that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the Street, was neither practical nor safe. The other obstacles was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building for the entire idea was dropped. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many hard obstacles.  "
