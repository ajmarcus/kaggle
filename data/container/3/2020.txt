"When architects and engineers planned on building the mooring dock for blimps on the Empire State building they didn't realize all the problems that could happen. One of these problems was a big safety issue. Most blimps used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flammable. If a blimp were to catch fire while on the Empire State, it would end in a disaster. Another obsticle was nature. The wind was unpredictable and the dirigibles would just be swinging in the wind. If the wind got to strong it could add a lot of stress to the building and it could colapse. One last reason was an actual law. The law stated it was illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. The mooring dock on the building would have never worked."
