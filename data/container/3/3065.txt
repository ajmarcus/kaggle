"The obstacles the builder's of the Empire state Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was safety, nature itself and the law.Safety because dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable and accident could happen like ""German dirigible Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey.""nature being the second problem because violent air currents could shift the dirigible and cause damage and hurt pedestrians.Law being the last reason because there was a law against air ships flying too low over urban areas. The statement in the excerpt says ""This law would make it illegal for ships to ever tie up to the building."" Which makes it quite pointless to have even built it in the first place."
