"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives the mood was well shown in a few ways. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwillingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally greatful)."" The mood is is happy and greatfull for what Narciso learned. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" In the parenthesis it emphasizes the love Narciso has for Cuban music even more. ""Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us, and Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often then not."" This here shows how friendly both the families are together and they are happy to enjoy these meals."
