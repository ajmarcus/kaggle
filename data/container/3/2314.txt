"Builders trying to allow dirigibles to dock ontop of the empire state building faced problems. The dirigibles waight and the wind pressure would add stress to the Building. Wich @CAPS1 to be transmitted more then @NUM1 ft down to the buildings foundation. Construction wasn't the only problem. Most @CAPS2-American dirigibles are held afloat by hellium wich is extremely flammable and if it was @CAPS3 over busy + crowded New York streets many people could have been killed. Nature added to the problems. Wind currents had the pottential to push dirigibles Into @CAPS4 buildings, causing them to pop. The finall problem was @CAPS5 already implace wich didn''t allow low flying aircrafts. Builders faced Problems with Nature, @CAPS5, safety, and construction wich lead to the demise of the use of the mooring system."
