"In the memoir ""@PERSON1"" by himself he creates a tone of love. It is tone of love because he explains that his parents taught him many great things. Also that he is grateful and thankful to everything his parent's gave him, as it says in paragraph @NUM1. For example he explains that family doesn't have to be blood related. His parents taught him that anybody you can trust his family, anybody that you help because you know they will do the same for you. Also in the last sentence it says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". So the author's tone for his memoir is love and that he is grateful for everything with his parents."
