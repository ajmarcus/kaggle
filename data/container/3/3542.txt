"In the excerpt  ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, there are many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced. The task of the building something on the Empire State Building that would allow dirigibles to dock there was a daring and dangerous job.There were many obstacles the builders faced. One obstacle was the winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would make building very difficult because everything would get blown around. Another obstacle was that ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" That means the builders first had to make the building strong enough to hold the docking place before they could start building the docking place.These two obstacles that the builders faced made building the docking place much harder. It took much longer because they first had to make the frame of the building stronger. Also they had to watch the wind so that they would not get hurt."
