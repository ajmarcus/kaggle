"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. The architects could not just put the mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. ""A dirigible would be held to the building by a single cable tether, which would add stress to the buildings frame."" (LŸsted @NUM1) The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted down to the foundation. ""The building's steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" (LŸsted @NUM1) ""Over sixty thousand dollars of modifications would have to be made."" (LŸsted @NUM1) The building was based entirely around the mooring mast. New modifications were only used to support the blimp itself and not other factors like nature winds."
