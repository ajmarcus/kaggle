"The mood is created by the auther in the authe in the memoir by. ""Narciso Rodriguez and internally reconized @CAPS1 desiner, offers the following definition of ""family""."" @CAPS2 @CAPS3 what and all the diffienetions of family and what a family is. ""Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my badysitter and my first friend) lived above us and Alegria graced our kitchen table more often than not"". Alegra was @CAPS4 as a part of the family not by blood not by chose but by @CAPS5 because @CAPS6 understand the Rodriguez's family @CAPS6 liked them so @CAPS6 becacme part of there family and they became part of her family. ""Here, the innocence of childhood the Congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"". When your away from Home every thing you do is different the way you sleep, eat, talk, react, is all different except when your home every thing is normal again. family isn't by blood but by heart of @CAPS5 and Home isn't where you live it's where familiy is it's where memoris are that's How the mood is set by the auther"
