"The obstacles builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire were saefty, nature, and U.S law. Saefty was a major obstacle because, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United states used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1 lin @NUM2). Nature itself was another obstacle faced in allowing dirigibles to dock at the empire state building. ""The Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3 line @NUM4). One final obstacle that would hault the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State building was U.S law. The law was agaist airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illeagle for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approch the area"" (@CAPS1 @NUM5 line @NUM6)."
