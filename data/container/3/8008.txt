"By writing the story, the author created a mood full of warmth and comfort. The mood created in this story shows how family should be. When @PERSON1 says that ""they take anyone in until they are back on their feet"", this shows that they appreciate their family and they are all close. This shows that they care for one another contributes to the mood by showing love and warmth towards another person. A second way about the mood is when he talks about his kitchen and how much it means to him. When he talks about the love of culinary skills and cooking which is still with him today it creates a solemn mood that sets the tone of the story. Third, where he talks about his neighborhood. @PERSON1 talks about the immigrants in the area and how they come together with their different backgrounds. This shows that they show affection for one another and that everyone is the same. This sets the mood too by showing everybody needs to be nice to everyone. These three parts set the ""mood of the story."
