"There were many problems the builders of the Empire state building faced when it came to dirigibles.They faced problems with ""... Violent air currents"" That flow above the building. These would constantly be pushing the ships as they tried to dock, and sway the back end while they were docked. Another problem was that there was an ""... existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This would make it basically illegal to dock an airship on the Empire State building. These obstacles described in ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia LŸsted show why the spire at the top of the Empire State building was never used to dock dirigibles."
