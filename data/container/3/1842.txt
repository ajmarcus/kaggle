"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For one thing, the builders couldn't simply place a mast on top of the empire state building, because the building would surely collapse. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the empire state building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". To change and fix this problem, over sixty thousand dollars would be needed for the modifications. Another obstacle the builder's failed to see was the actual construction of a modern-day dirigible. The dirigibles, ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly Flammable"". If the dirigibles were to ever explode while docking, the situation would have been horrible over a densely populated area of New York. Lastly, the greatest obstacle of the building was nature itself. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around"". this would be very dangerous. The dirigible could @CAPS1 over pedestrians the streets meaning it was not safe at all. There are three obstacles that prevented the empire state building from allowing dirigibles to dock there."
