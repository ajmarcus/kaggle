"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to let the dirigibles dock there. One obstacle the builders faced was the ""lack of a suitable landing area."" (paragraph six) A second obstacle is the amount of stress a dirigible would put onto the building. As the author states in paragraph nine, ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation."" The author also states that in order for the invention to work out, the Empire State building's steel frame would have to have more strength to it and it would have to be modified to accommodate the new idea. The greatest obsticle faced was due to the nature of where the building was located. Because of the location, the winds were so strong and the wind shifted constantly. The last obsticle the builders faced was ""a law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" By the late nineteen thirtie's, the idea landing dirigibles on the Empire State Building disappeared. Instead, the idea of air transportation was given to airplanes."
