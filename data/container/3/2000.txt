"In this excerpet from the mooring mast by marcia amidon, there was alot of examples of obstacles that the builders of the empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one oBstacle that the builders faced was the weight and presure of a DiriGiBle @CAPS1 on @CAPS2 one teather at the top of the empire state building. this was a big @CAPS3 because all the stress and pressure of the rope would pull on the building sending the preasure all the way to the bottom of the building one thousand feet below. another obstacle that the workers faced was nature its self. this was a @CAPS3 because of the high speed winds at the building shifting all the time. If a DiriGiBle was to be teathered at the top by only one rope in the front the back of it would be free to move in the wind. this would allow the back to be able to be blown by the wind having the possibility of hitting the building. In conclusion there were many obsticles builders had to face to attempt this project."
