"In the story “Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affected the cyclist a lot. At first, when the cyclist set off in the morning, the conditions were great. It was breezy with shade from trees and rivers. Then, after a few hours, the cyclist was in the desert with bumpy hills. In the story, the speaker states, “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The condition of the roads and not having water really affected the cyclist. It took more energy to get up and down the hills without any shade which ment that he needed more water which he didn’t have any. The condition of the setting really affect the cyclist and if it was easier to bike, they might have not be so dehydrated."
