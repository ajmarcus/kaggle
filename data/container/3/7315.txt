"The mood created by the author in the memoir is many things. But, I think the main moods in the memoir are happy and greatful. I think the mood of the story is happy because the story tells about all the good times @PERSON1 had in his house. For example, @PERSON1 says ""here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" And, I think the mood of the story is also thankful because a lot of the story has to do with @PERSON1 thanking his parents for all they have done and sacrificed for him. For example, in the end of the memoir @PERSON1 says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" and in a way thanks his parents for everything. So, as you can see those are the moods I think the author created in the memoir."
