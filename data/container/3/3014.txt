"First, there was no way to anchor any dirigibles. They couldn't make the back stable, only if they added lead weights; that wasn't a good idea above a crowded street. Second, there were laws in place stating that a dirigible couldn't fly that close to buildings. Also, when the German blimp Hindenburg was destroyed by fire near a New Jersey naval base, people thought ""... how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" @CAPS1, the wind that high up was too fierce and strong for a blimp to even get close to the building. All in all it was a bad idea."
