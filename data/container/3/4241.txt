"The features in the setting most definetly affect the cyclist while he travels. The cyclist is incredibly thirsty and tired and the setting hes placed in just gives him no hope of survival really. He first comes to a ghost town where he finds no one is living. This first encounter with isolation in a desolute place doesnt really affect him because it is the first place he finds but the rest of the storys setting comes to mimic this. As he travels he is met with barren land, no water and no people in sight. Its June in California and the cyclist fears he @MONTH1 soon suffer from heat stroke if he doesnt find water yet. It doesnt help when he comes to an abandoned juice factory that taunts him with the one thing he needs to survive. All in all the features in the setting make the cyclist lose hope, make him feel like he will die if he dosent find water."
