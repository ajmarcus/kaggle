"The setting in Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit was a very large factor of the story that was actually the cause of the protagonists problem throughout. First it started off with the large hills he had to ride up, making him work harder and tire himself out quickly. Next the big problem was the heat of June,  and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because  The heat was so really bad because it made him hot, thus depleting his water supply [which he needed to survive] and it gave the large, almost inevitable risk of falling from a heatstroke and dying. The heat also made the abandoned Juice Factory all the more ironic and bitter for the protagonist. A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. @CAPS1, in the unbearable heat with no water left and @CAPS2 knows how many miles left to cycle, this really made him feel like the sorriest, unluckiest man in the world. The setting overall, seemed almost crafted to make the protagonist not only suffer from the natural elements, but from things that seemed meant purely taunt him for it. "
