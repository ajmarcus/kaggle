"Based on the excerpt ""The @CAPS1 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, There were many obstacles the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1. To allow dirigibles to dock their. One of their main obstacles the builders @ORGANIZATION1 was the frame work. They had to design it so the building could bear the stress of the dirigible. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and wind Pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". In order to make it work they would use diffrent Steel. Another obstacle the builder @ORGANIZATION1 would be safety. Winds and hydrogen were main focuses. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, hydrogen is highly flammable, The winds on top of the building were. Constantly Shifting due to violent air currents."" They would also be careful of pedestrians ""they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street"". Those are just two examples of what the builders of the Empire State Building @ORGANIZATION1."
