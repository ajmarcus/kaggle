"In an attempt to build a dirigble destination, in the Empire State Building, the architects had to deal with @CAPS3 problems like a dirigble mishap or simply nature itself.@CAPS3 problems like a blimp crash would be costly, lives would be lost in the densely populated city and the explosion could destroy buildings around and to the Empire State Building itself. To prevent this from happening the Government had already made a law that banned flying aircraft from going to close to urban areas. To build this @CAPS1 the architects would have to break laws or bend rules. Another conflicting idea, that disrupted, plans for a dirigble docking station would be nature, harsh winds could easily sway a blimp, and swaying could cause the blimp to punture on a nearby building, ""Even if the dirigble were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would still swivel around the mooring mast."" (@CAPS2 @NUM1) The swiveling as mentioned earlier could hit near by building and harm civilians. The @CAPS3 problems and laws that kept the Mast from being created should have been realized before, the idea will never be possible."
