"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng’s outlook on the future. It is a fitting conclusion, drawing from numerous elements in the story, and it shows how Saeng has grown. Saeng refers to “When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” In this phrase she shows a growing acceptance and even an affection for her new homeland. The geese are “familiar to Saeng now “ despite her thinking of them as “strange before.” The hibiscus is a piece of her past, adapted to fit her current situation. Saeng’s vow that she will “take that test again” in the spring, “When the snows melt…”etc. This shows that despite losing so much - her home, her grandmother, her way of life - Saeng is still determined to make the best of her situation. She plans on passing her driving test come spring, no matter what. The concluding paragraph is a fitting way to wrap up the story. It was how the thrends of Saeng’s past and her present are entwined , and displays her attitude towards the future. With its optimistic words the final paragraph nearly ties up the mood of optimism amidst regret. The author’s wording was very well done."
