"The mood of the boy in this story was he was happy talking about how his whole family could come to his house for any meal in the day. Also his friends could come over too. While he was explainng how he didn't ever get to meet his real grandparents from Cuba he didn't sound as happy as before the text was more happy. At the end of this memoir the boy said "" I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" When he said that his mood went to happy and thankful for everything his parents gave him in his life also like the main thing is  his cooking skills came from his parents too @CAPS1 he is very thankful for what he has. That is the boys mood in the story."
