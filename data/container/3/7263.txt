"The mood created by the author in the memoir was very thankful. The author proved that it doesn't take the amount of money, or how big your house is to be happy. Sometimes its just the simple things. In paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" The author is showing the reader that even though they might not be family by blood, they still treat each other as if they were. In the last sentence of the memoir it reads, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows the reader that no house is a home without happy memories and great lessons learned."
