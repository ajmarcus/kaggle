"Based on the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood could be a lot of things. The mood created by the author in the memoir is a @CAPS2 mood. first of all I know this because in paragraph @NUM1 it said ""... and for wich I am eternally grateful."" also it said ""wich I adore to this Day."" How I know that those where a @CAPS2 moode because if I where to say that it be @CAPS2, also there was nothing saying that @CAPS1 disliked it. Second of all, @CAPS1 would all ways tell his Parents that ""I will always be grateful to my Parents fo thier love and sacrifice."" also told them ""I've often told them of admiration for their strenth and Perseverance. There for the wood of the memoir is those two reasons why it is a @CAPS2 mood that the author created."
