"The mood created by the author, Narciso Rodriguez, in his memoirs is very proud of his parents and happy. ""... lived above us, and Alegria graced our kitchen table more often than not."" The author is happy, remembering memories, which are not unhappy or unpleasant. It's not romantic, lonely, or sad, it's happy, fun-filled, friendly, and fulfilled. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Narciso is very appreciative of his parents, moving so @CAPS1 could have a better life and education than them. @CAPS1 expresses his gratitude toward them a lot. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 writes about how @CAPS1 told them what they did was a more courageous thing than @CAPS1 ever could have done, and his admiration for their perseverance and strength. @CAPS1 really does love and appreciate his parents and everything they did for him, that being a main theme of the memoir. The mood @CAPS2 and created by Narciso Rodriguez is proud and admiring of his parents, and very happy."
