"The mood created by the author in ""Narciso Rodriguez""is very calm and happy. The author This very calm and cool. There are no loud or emphasized parts. It is also very happy. It describes a family growing and getting to love each other. Also frends and more family having happy times having celebrations. The happiest line was the last, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple little house into a home."" It also has a very loving tone to it. Anything about a family coming together is loving."
