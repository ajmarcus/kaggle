""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich  culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..."" This quote shows that the mood was cheerful and calm. The mood the author created was the friendliness of family and friendship between the family and how other people would join them into his family house. The author made the mood like an instilled enviroement as like he was growing up in ""this environment instilled in me a great sense of ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."
