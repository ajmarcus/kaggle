"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock this included not being able to put a mooring mast at the top of the building in fear that because the dirigible was being held by a ""single cable"" it ""would add stress to the buildings frame."" @CAPS1 with the amount the dirigible @PERSON1 and the wind the buildings frame would not be strong enough and would have to be ""modified and strengthened."" Another obstacle in attempting to get the dirigibles to dock was the wind. The building was high up @CAPS1 the wind currents were volatile and ""constantly shifting"" in result the back of the dirigibles ""would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" @CAPS2 obstacle faced by the builders was that they were trying to build the mooring mast in an urban area with other buildings, close by the dirigible could be pierced and would also be dangerous for the pedestrians in the city."
