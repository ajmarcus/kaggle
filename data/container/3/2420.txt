"In a competition with architect building the Chrysler Building, Al Smith wanted to construct a taller building with a purpose. That purpose would be to dock dirigibles on a mooring mast. This seemed like a good idea, taking a mode of transportation very popular and new and allowing it to run in New York City. Then their were problems, in the beginning the architects knew that ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"". So, with the time thay had, they assumed that they fixed the problem, but when it was finished the architects knew that ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to fufil it's purpose..."" Most of the problems didn't arise from the building but the practicality of having a dirigible land in a big crowded city, such as the highly flamable hydrogen that fills most dirigibles or the closeness of the other buildings to the blimps could cause them to burn. Overall the idea was good in theory, but could never be excuted. Only two dirigibles ever docked their and it has never been used since"
