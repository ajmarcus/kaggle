"During the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, builders faced many obstacles. One obstacle builders faced was the building's @CAPS1. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the [Empire State Building] held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's Frame."" Another obstacle in the way was nature itself. The reason was that the winds on top of the Empire State Building was always changing because of violent air currents. This was dangerous because ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" @CAPS2, there is a law in the United States against airships Flying too low over urban areas."" This would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the [Empire State Building] or even approach the area. Many more obstacles were faced during the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State @CAPS3, but that didn't stop the workers from doing their job."
