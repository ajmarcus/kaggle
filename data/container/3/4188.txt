"In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by @PERSON1, the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. The first major example is when the cyclist finds that the flat road is turning into “short, rolling hills,” These hills are increasing the difficulty and are causing him doubt that he will make it. An additional part of the setting which caused major doubt was that he was in a deserted desert. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The horizon was what kept cyclist going. “I began breaking the ride down into distarres: I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fine.’ The horizon kept him hopeful and determined. Without the setting he would not have been in such a serious but luckily in the end the setting helped him be determined enough to make it."
