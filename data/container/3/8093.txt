"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a very specific mood. He talks about family, love, and home. For example, Narciso says that the heart of his home was the kitchen, and there was always passionate Cuban music playing. In his neighborhood, Narciso says that ""cultures came together"" and that his parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" I can tell how important friends and family are to Narciso and his family and how welcoming and caring they are. Narciso believes that his home was filled with ""not just scent and music, but life and love."" I believe the mood of his house was not only obvious to Narciso, but to his neighbors and family too."
