"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there. One obstacle they faced was that if a thousand-foot dirigible was moored at the top of the building by a single cable tether, it would add stress to the building's frame. Another obstacle they faced was that most dirigibles from outside the united states used hydrogen not helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Those are some of the obstacles they faced trying to dock on the building."
