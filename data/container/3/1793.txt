"The builders of the Empire State Building a great idea. They wanted to be able to tethered dirigibles, or blimps, to the top of the building. However, there were many problems with this idea. First of all, blimps themselves were not very sturdy. Strong winds could easily blow dirigibles trying to dock into the spires of other buildings. Dirigibles also started to use hydrogen gas rather than Helium. Hydrogen gas is extremely flammable. The smallest the sparking could set the whole blimp ablaze. The docking system its self was also a problem. The only way to keep a dirigible level was to hang lead weights off the side. One concern was that a way could fall off and fall into the densely populated city below. This could've proved very disastrous!"
