"In Marcia Amidon Lsted excerpt The Mooring Mast, is about the empire state that was built to being the tallest building. There are copious of ways of the builders faced attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In the excerpt it states, ""Most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium (hydrogen is more flammable)"". This @CAPS1 proves how it's likely to destroy the whole entire empire state with Fire. Another @CAPS1 that portrays how builders faced attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there when it states,... ""Dangling high above pedestrians on the street was practical nor safe"". This @CAPS1 @CAPS4 the safty of the people walking on the @CAPS5 and what if they get hurt. finally another @CAPS1 that portrays the obtacles the builders faced when it states, ""... blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings"". This @CAPS1 proves if the dirigibles blow the empire it's not the only building in danger others around it too."
