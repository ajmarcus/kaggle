The builders had many obstacles in their way to accomplish their Idea of docking dirigibles. One main problem was that most dirigibles around the world used hydrogen gas which is highly flammable which can make things very dangerous at such an altitude.                                                 The greatest obstacle to it's success was nature itself. The winds where the docking would occur were constantly shifting and this would make the stability of the dirigible very difficult with the back end stretching so far away from the tower. Another reason this wouldn't work was because of an already existing law against air ships flying so low over urban areas.
