Narciso is stating how impressed and generous his parents were and he realizes how important friends and family are in paragraph @NUM2. Narciso also states in paragraph @NUM2 that the two lessons that he learn wasn't just taught, but were shown by his parents lives. I think that this story was very touching and created a lot of mood and emotion as I was reading."
