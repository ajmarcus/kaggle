"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced. One of the obstacles faced was when trying to dock on top of the building. Since it was so tall, there were very harsh winds that the dirigibles could be controlled. When the Los Angeles tried to dock there, it couldn't, because ""[it] could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" Also, ""the @CAPS1. could not even take his hands off the control levers."" because the dirigible might bump into other buildings if he did. Another obstacle they faced was that New York was densely populated and the mooring mast was surrounded by other buildings. If it caught on fire like the Hindenburg it could be a huge problem. ""... how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area."" The third huge obstacle they faced was that there was an actual law against anything flying that low in cities. There was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This meant that the dirigibles couldn't even get close enough to tie up since they were allowed to fly down to it. Since there were so many apparent obstacles and flaws in the plan, the builders should've caught it before and never built the mooring mast above the Empire State Building"
