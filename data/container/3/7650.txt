"The mood the @CAPS1 creats in the memoir is a mixture. In reading the story you feel happy, and greatfull, this is because the @CAPS1 is stating how great her family and friends were, along with how great her life was. She also states that you dont need alot of money or a big house to be happy. In paragraph @NUM1 she says ""I will always be greatfull to my parets for their love and sacrifice."" This says to me, that very happy and she very greatfull to have parents like she does and that she would never want to loose them. She also states in paragraph @NUM1 ""in reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity..."" To me, everyone should be this gratfull to their family and loved ones because you never know when you're going to loose one"
