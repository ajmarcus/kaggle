"There was many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that a lot of dirigibles outside the @LOCATION4 use hydrogen over helium. The problem was hydrogen is highly flammable, ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densley populated area such as downtown New York City."" @CAPS1 can only imagine how tragic and chaotic that would have been. Another obstacle the builders faced was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting do to violent air currents. That would've meant that these dirigibles could just have got swept back. In conclusion there was several obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
