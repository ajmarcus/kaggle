"The mood created by the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is very uplifting and happy. One reason I think the memoir is uplifting and happy is because it talks about how greatful Narciso is of his parents. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will allways be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" I thought that this line was very meaningful and uplifting because he's basicaly thanking his parents for immigrating and giving him a better life. Another reason I think this article is uplifting and happy is because in paragraph @NUM2 it says ""Growing up in this enviorment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with a blood relative."" I found that uplifting because essentially what he is saying that family doesn't allways mean who you are related to but the people around you that love and support you. Lastly this article is uplifting because it shows love can make a difference."
