"Based on the article, ""the Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, there are many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. @ORGANIZATION2 states in paragraph @NUM1, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons have been aparent before it was ever constructed."" One reason was safety. The dirigibles that were made outside of @LOCATION1 contained hydrogen instead of helium, thats wrong because hydrogen is highly flammable. Another reason was because of the winds. They constantly change, they are violent air currents, and they moved the dirigible. The other reason and most important reason is because dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building because its illegal. There is a law against airships fly too low over urban areas and for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach it was illegal. There were many obstacles the builders went through."
