"The mood created by the author in the memoir is gratitude and happiness. Narciso repeatedly states how grateful he is to his parents for showing him what it really means to be a family and having selflessness and caring. He says, ""In reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" When he is recollecting memories from his childhood he shows how there was a lot of happiness in their home. He says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" With his memoir, Narciso creates a great mood filled with gratitude, happiness, and a sense of childhood."
