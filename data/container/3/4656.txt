"The hot, dry, desert setting affects the cyclist in many different ways, I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June (@NUM1). The cyclist is very hot. He was thirsty but, A tarlike substance ooted out, followed by brakish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of zoo (@NUM2). The water was barely even water, so he didnt have much to drink until the next town. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling  hills (@NUM3). Flat road is much easier to bike on then hills. He was thirstier and more tired after biking on hills A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth could still be seen (@NUM4) on an old welchs grape fruit factory. This makes the cyclist envicus of the young boy. It also discourages him. In conclusion, the water being bad, the terrain change. the picture of the young boy, and the fact that the cyclist drinks a lot makes him tired, hot, envious, and generally exausted."
