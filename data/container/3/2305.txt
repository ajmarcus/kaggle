"Architects had to face many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire State building. The very first problem architects faced was adding a mooring mast to the building because they could not Simply just drop one on, they had to go back and re-support the whole skeleton of the building. Another problem is if the dirigible were to fail like the hindenburg it would plument in a ball of fire to a very populated city down below. The greatest problems architects had to face was nature itself There were violent winds constantly if a dirigible had been tethered down it would move violently and go @CAPS1 down on pedestrians down below, which is too much of a risk for the architects to take."
