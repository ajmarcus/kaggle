"The mood created by the author in the memoir was ""solidority."" because in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their non culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me to today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate cuban music (which I adore to this day filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" also in paragraph @NUM2 it says. ""growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that ""family had nothing to do with being blood related."" This is now the mood created by the author was ""solidarity""."
