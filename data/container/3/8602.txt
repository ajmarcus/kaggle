"The mood of this memoir is grateful. Narciso Rodriguez's parent both move to @LOCATION2 from Cuba to give their children a better life than what they had. Narciso's parents lived in a one room house untill they moved to New Jersey, were Narciso grew up. Inside that home the family created a beautiful Cuban communitie. The heart of the house was the kitchen. Where they played Cuban music all the time. The part of New Jersey were the Rodriguez family lived was filled with Spanish, Cuban, and Italian imigrants. The community was like a big family, ""the cultures cam together in great solidarity and friendship."" All of these cultures that came together really showed Narciso what a ""family"" really means. She never would have know what that ment or have had these oppertunities if her parents hadn't been selfless. They came here and had to start their lives over. As Narciso says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."""
