When the speaker says almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become This example shows that she had lost touch with the realness of nature and that was what was going to get her to pass the test. The author sets an impatient mood for  the reader because it took her for winter to discover this, and winter is when its too late,  the geese have left and the flower has closed, so when spring comes theyll be open to new opportunities and so will she with the familarity around her.
