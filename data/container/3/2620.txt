"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstactles in allowing drigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the safety of New York people. They could have used hydrogen and the dirigible could have caught on fire and landed somewhere bad. As said in paragraph @NUM1, ""The greatest obstacle to the succesful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents. Even if they were tethered to the mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mast Another was there is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The idea of using the mooring mast had quietly disappeared."
