"During the cyclists trip, he experienced physical and mental strain. The intense heat, rough terrain, the animals and his isolation all contributed to his strain while completing his challenging task. His isolation while cycling down the shortcut was a definite factor in his strain. @PERSON1 stated that,  there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. All @PERSON1 had to focus on was accomplishing his task. There wasnt anybody nearby to help him and there wasnt any shelter for him to take to escape the heat. The heat itself played a very predominant factor in Kurmaskies physical strain. The heat caused him to become dangerously thirsty and required him to find an abundance of water fast. Kurmaskie stated,  the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke This statement proves that the intense temperature was a life threatening factor. The rough terrain and snake and two factors in his trip that just helped make his journey even more cruel. The physical strain of avoiding a snake in the middle of the road and the dangerous terrain just put him in a more grading position. "
