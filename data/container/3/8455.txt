"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that of love, kindness, and welcome. This is true because the author uses adjectives such as passionate, warm, humble, and simple to describe how the family lives surrounded by kind people with a loving ambience. Also, the author describes how his family always welcomed others into their home and received a similar kindness back. This, @CAPS1 describes, is because they consider everyone as family, which, as Narciso believes, is because of their love for each other. finally, the author explains how @CAPS1 is extremely grateful to his parents ""for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 states that @CAPS1 ""thanked them repeatedly."" This also shows how Narciso wrote his memoirs to be full of love, especially for his parents, which dictated the mood of the piece."
