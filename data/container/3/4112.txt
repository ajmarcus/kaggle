"The features of the setting affect the authors dispotion as well as his ability to complete the journey, thus creating an obstacle the author must overcome. At the end of the paragraph five the author writes that ÒI was traveling through the high deserts of California.Ó This setting is important because it adds a sense of urgency to his trip when he starts to run low on water. This is similair to when I was backpacking and a bear got most of our food. Our normal backpacking trip had become more of a game of survival. So, the water issue was clearly the main point of of conflict that the author presented in the setting. He also writes that ÒNot two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.Ó This aspect of the setting also affects the cyclist because it makes it much harder for him to progress than if it was a downhill road. In short, the setting of the story presents the main points of conflict to the author and thus was essential to the essay."
