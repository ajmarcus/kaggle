"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many @CAPS2 in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders had a real hard time with this construction of the morning mast. They had to deal with the frame work of the building. A big obstacle they had was that they didn't have a suitable landing area for the dirigibles. They didn't just have to deal with man made @CAPS2, but nature's @CAPS2 as well. The wind on the top of the building made it nearly impassible to land safely. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). The constructors of the building realized that to make this plan possible they would have to redo the frame of the building. The building wasn't even designed to be able to allow dirigibles to land on the top of the building. The workers were blind to see all the possible problems with the design of the moorning mast. The @CAPS2 the workers had to go through were to much and the landing of the dirigibles never worked."
