"The moods created by the author in the memoir are loving, care, family, sacrafice, and warmth. All of these moods are demonstrated when the author describes all of what her interpretation of family is, and when she described everything her parents have done for her. The passage that states: ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."", @CAPS1 that the parents sacrificed so much, and cared and loved their children so much that they were willing to give up their lives in their country and leave behind everything in order to make Narciso's life better. Their family provided warmth and care for everyone who needed it. They truly learned the real meaning of family. The author created a very loving mood in this memoir."
