"There were many obstacles the builders went through in trying to dock the dirigibles at the top of the Empire State Building. One to be exact would be the wind, although they would be tying the dirigible down the back was not and the wind would blow @ORGANIZATION2 decide. Which would affect the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" With this discovery they had to make some changes to the building, which would cost them more money. Other obstacles they went through were actually being able to have it dock, because it's a law that you can't do that with some he people below. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS1 are just a few of the obstacles that the architects went through out trying to dock dirigibles."
