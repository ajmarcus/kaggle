"The mood created by the author is welcoming. ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond brick building in the iron bound section of Newark, New Jersey."" This gives the feeling of being welcomed because it makes me feel like we just saw Narciso Rodriguez's house and we are about to walk in. ""In our neighborhood, despite custums elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solitary and friendship."" This makes me feel welcome because it doesn't matter if you are different you are still family. ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This gives me the feeling of being welcomed because it was imagery that makes me imagine and I'm able to picture this house, with brilliant smells and lovely cuban music playing. In conclusion, the mood of being welcomed is portrayed strongly throughout the memoir, especially when he is describing his home"
