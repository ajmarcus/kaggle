"Including the bit about taking the test again when the “hidiscus is budding” provides a sense of closeur and lesson to an otherwise open ending. Saeng fails the drivers test early in the story, then on her way home she buys a hibiscus. The reader really doesn’t see a connection until this last paragraph. The hibiscus represents perserverence and strength. After a harsh winter this hibiscus can bloom again and ard continue to live. Even after moving from Vietnam, and struggling to adapt, Saeng must recover, ard keep trying. Just like the flower blooming again, so will Saeng. She will take the test a second time and pass. She will adapt to her environment, and keep going, just like the hibiscus."
