"Home is where the heart is, and nothing says that more than in the memoir Home: The Blueprints of My life. In the memoir, it talks about family and that where ever your heart is, is where your home is. The memior and gives a tingling and loving mood. It makes us feel happy and feel loving, especially in a few sections.First, when the author talked about what his familly did at home, it made theworld slow down and think about the family. Narcisoc (the author and narrator) said in paragraph two, ""endless celebrations and that encompassed both, formed the back drop to our life in our warm home"". This made a picture of a happy and laughing family like in the movies about the holidays.Second, Narciso said how united they all were. This painted a mood of unity and care. In paragraph four @PERSON1 recalled, ""My parents always kept thier arms and thier door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us"". The makes the reader think of friendship and hope in trouble times.The mood that came was loving and that tingling feeling of hope. Most people can't find that feeling anymore, especially in these tough times. What most people do know is that and home is not a building, it's a santurary."
