"The setting of the authors  shortcut effected his performance and strength tremendously . whether it was the hills, heat or barren landscape all three took their toll on Joe Kurmaskie. Not only that, but his lack of water depleted his energy as well. Flat road was repalced by short rolling hills. The hills were a tough thing to pass since Joe was being drained of energy. He overcame this exhaustion when a building came into views. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasnt a mirage, and tried not to get too excited with what I believed was my last burst of energy. I manouvered down the hill. The authour overcame all the problems ne faced even though it was difficult. He seems to have written this piece to exaggrate how important it is to keep going when you want to give up. Winston churchill once said,  success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage it takes to continues that counts. I believe that @PERSON2 agrees."
