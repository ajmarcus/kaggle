"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles. As stated in paragraph 1 of the excerpt, the Empire State building was planned to be the tallest building in the world in the @DATE2's. The architect of the Chrysler building constructed the building to be 46 ft taller then the Empire State building. Governor of New York, Al Smith did not want loose the tittle of the tallest building. In paragraph 6 it tells you Smith's idea: A mooring mast was added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service. And to let passengers on & off.Safety issues did not allow the mooring mast of the Empire State building to fulfill its person, said in paragraph @NUM1. Most dirigibles from outside the @PERSON2 used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flamable. Because of pointy buildings this was extremely dangerous. As stated in paragraph @NUM2; the greatest obstacle was nature. On top of the Empire State building, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Also, the law to fly too low. By the late 1930's the mooring mast plan disappeared."
