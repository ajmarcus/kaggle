"I think the mood that this author is creating is love, happiness, and respect. He really admired and cared for his parents. In @CAPS1 @NUM1, the author remembers, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came here selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" @CAPS2 of the mood is that they took their cuban styles and culture, and brought it to @LOCATION1, living in a simple house. Determination also plays a big @CAPS2. The author's parents were determined to have their kid have a better life. Mood is the overall @CAPS3 in the story, so I think it would be a mixture of happiness, unity, caring, and determination."
