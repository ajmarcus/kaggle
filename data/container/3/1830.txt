"In the excerpt from, ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, tells about the original purpose to the mast on top of the Empire State Building was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles (blimps).Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the tremendous stress that the mast would put on the Empire State Building. In order to get around this, they put frame work around the entire building's frame. Another obstacle that was faced was safety. First of all, the wind at the top of the Empire State Building was to great for any blimp to stay aloft in mid-air without being tossed around. Finally, the possibility of the blimp either popping on the spikes, or blowing up because of the hydrogen, over New York City.In conclusion, the mast on the Empire State Building, looked good on paper, but once you add in natural elements, the mast had too many flaw to it."
