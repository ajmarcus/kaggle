"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy and warm. This is shown in two ways: the selflessness of the parents and the true meaning of family. Narciso Rodriguez, the author, is forever grateful to his parents for starting their lives over so he could live a good life in @LOCATION1 This is shown in paragraph @NUM1 when he explains that his parents loved Cuba but left so their children could have a better life in @LOCATION1. He gives his thanks to his parents in paragraph @NUM2. This feeling of gratefulness contributes to the warm, happy feel of the piece.      Throughout the piece Narciso explains to us the true meaning of family ""'... family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative,"" he states in paragraph @NUM3. In paragraph @NUM4, he explains that family means those who care for and about you and stick by you no matter what. This feeling of family definitely helps to make the piece feel warm and happy."
