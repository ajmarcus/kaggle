"The author set a great mood of love and gratefulness in this memoir. In paragraph @NUM1, @CAPS1 explains that his parents left Cuba with quite goods jobs. His father worked in a laboratory and his mother studied chemical engineering. They both came to the @LOCATION2 and had to work in whatever job they could find, although they deserved much better ones. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 is very thankful for what his parents have done, how much they have given up in order for their kids to have a better life His parents showed him in their everyday lives the spirit of how to be generous at such an early age, and the true importance of family and friends. They didn't just ""tell"" him to live this way, they based their lives in this belief. that's the reason @CAPS1 has taken these teaching to be the basis of his life. These are the ways in which the author sets a mood of love and gratefullness in this memoir."
