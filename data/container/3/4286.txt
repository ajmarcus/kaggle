"The lone biker in Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit by @PERSON1 is strongly affected by the features of the landscape. The sun is the most important factor; it drives him to first consume his water quickly, and then drives him search for a water source.The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it...I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, in this quote, it reveals that even though the biker had not acknowledged the sun, his body had required water, depleting his supply in his water bottles. A lack of water feeling two hundred degrees...it had the flavor of battery acid."" The only water that the bike is able to find is not consumable. The most important of the factors, in the matter of survival, is the fish camp that the biker finally reaches. I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink. The biker had been on the brink of dehydration and the fish camp is where he finally reganed the strength to continue on his journey."
