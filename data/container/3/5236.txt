The features for the cyclist in rough road ahead is not the kind lD  war a be in at forts. I thought it was going to be  a scenery story but it turns out he want that prepared. He took directions from some olden guys who havent left their house sense carter was in office. He was a bike peddaling threw the California desert with the things you can carry cause your on a bike. He ran out of water and could of got heatstroke or colapsed in the middle of nowhere with no one around to save him. So the heat gone drive you insane and make you thirty and you have a bite. The conditions this biker is in  hormone and I dont think he was prepared. Always stick in your gut.
