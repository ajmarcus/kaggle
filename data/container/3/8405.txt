"The author of the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, talks a lot about home and how you can find family were your not expecting too.He sets the mood in the memoir, that portrays love, warmth, and happyness. The overall mood of the memoir is loveing. Like how Narciso says in paragraph @NUM1, ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about love.""When Narciso was growing up he learned that ""... Family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" All the cultures in his neighborhood came together in unity and Friendship. So Narciso Rodriguez wants to create a warm, loving, @CAPS1 mood to his memoir, just like he experienced growing up!"
