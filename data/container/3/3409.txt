"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. The builders had to consult with experts and take tours of the equipment used in building mooring masts, land dirigibles service and a workable arrangement, and modify the building for support of the mast.In preparation to the construction of the mast the architects first took tours of the equipment at the @ORGANIZATION1. The builders also met with the president of an airship transport company that offered their services across the Pacific Ocean. A workable arrangement had to be created. It was difficult and tedious to figure, ""on some safe way of mooring ships to this mast."" The foundation of the building had to be considered as well because, ""the architects could not simply dropping mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" Over @MONEY1 in modifications to the frame and foundation of the building had to be performed. All of these were obstacles in the way of architects building a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building."
