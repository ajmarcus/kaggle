"I think the mood the author set is loving. The story says how there was a love for cooking and a passion for Cuban music. Just how endless celebrations brought life in there warm home. Narciso Rodriguez also had a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. ""In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, although these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" How there parents always had their arms and door open to many people knowing they would do the same for them. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" ""I will never forget how my parents turned a simple house into a home."" The mood @PERSON2 set for this story is loving."
