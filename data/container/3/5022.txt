"The setting affected the cyclist because the terrain you ride on can determine how you ride. For instance when you have hills and dry weather like they did when it said flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills The one easy terrain was now made more difficult and only added to his frustration and his dehydration from having no water. Also the heat contributed plenty and it was there the whole time.  Sometimes he didnt seem to notice or feel it but it was there and it was taking energy from him: Like when it said, The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. He didnt know it but that took from him so he drank more water and that affected his ability to take enough to complete the ride."
