"The author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates a passionate mood in his experiences of having a ""home"" rather than just a house, and how growing up in such a different community has shaped the man he has become today. Narciso is forever grateful for his parents' willingness to give up their good lives in Cuba and move to @LOCATION1 for the sake of him. The selflessness and thoughtful choices Narciso's mother and father made truly don't have words that are able to describe it. Narciso feels that you don't have to be related, of the same background or believe in the same things in order to be ""family."" The loving atmosphere of living in the neighborhood of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants was created by the feeling of coming together and having a good time, despite all of the differences. Narciso cherishes the memories he has kept of his childhood very much and will always admire his parents for the sacrifices they made for him."
