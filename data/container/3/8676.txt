"In the excerpt Narciso Rodriguez the @CAPS1 sets a mood of relaxation, happiness, joy, and an overall feeling of over satisfaction and unity. The @CAPS1 describes his feelings of being at his home and how much it made him feel overjoyed. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" In this particular sentence the @CAPS1 is tring to get the mood as like a heaven on earth thing. The @CAPS1 while tring to give the reader factual information about his home, is also tring to exagerate the emotion and make it paradise. In paragraphs @NUM2, @NUM3 and @NUM4 the @CAPS1 emphasizes how courageous, kind, and selfless his parents are and how he will always be greatful to them for that. He shows it in statements like ""They came selflessly...to give their children a better life"" and ""Generosity and selflessness are two lessons my parents did not just tell me. They showed me their lives."" The @CAPS1 sets the mood in the story as paradise for everyone."
