"Narciso Rodriguez is very gracious and compassionate, and he will never forget the monumentous risk his parents made to leave everything behind to come to @LOCATION1 so he could have a better life. Narciso recalls how his parents had to take any job they could and ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This past @DATE1 I was in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3 and I had to stay with this family. This family was great to me, and I will never forget their uncany attitudes to give me whatever I want. When I read this passage this family immediatly popped into my mind. Narciso's mood is unbelievably grateful to levels most people don't have the chance to experience. Narciso will never forget his parents and the sacrifice they made for him."
