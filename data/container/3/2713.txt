"The builders faced many obstacles in attempting to ensure that dirigibles could dock at the Empire State Building. For example, the first problem that arose was construction of the mast atop the building. According to the excerpt, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" From this you immediately know that the frame of the Empire State Building would have to be properly modified in order for the dirigible to safely and successfully dock at the mast. Another minor issue was making the whole construction look decorative. ""... the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside..."" @CAPS1, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" @CAPS2, the winds at that altitude would have been to unstable for a dirigible to dock. The problem is that the winds could potentially ""swing"" the rear of the dirigible around the mast, which is extremely dangerous and risky."
