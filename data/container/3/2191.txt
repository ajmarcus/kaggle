"The concept of a docking mast for the Empire State Building met with failure because of a variety of reasons. One of the major problems was that it was directly over the downtown area of New York City which is very densely populated. After the Hindenburg fire in New Jersey, ""the owners... realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place over a densely populated area.""The second major obstacle was controlling a dirigible in the often violent winds at the top of the tower. It was the practice at the time to control the back of the dirigible with lead weights but over a civilian area this was ""neither practical nor safe.""Another important reason why the builders faced obstacles was the already existing law that prohibited low-flying aircraft over cities. Despite the two dirigibles that approached the mooring mast, neither managed to allow passengers to disembark, and the idea was ""quietly dropped"" as it should have been. There were too many obstacles for it to succeed."
