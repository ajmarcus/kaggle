"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a combonation of calm, nice, and happy. It could also be described as heavenly.Narciso reffers to his childhood like it was one happy dream. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home"". He also mentions how greatful he is to his parents. ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"". One last fact that contributes to the mood of this memoir, is Narciso's view on family. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative... In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship"".From this excerpt it is clear that the author cherish this time, and would love to go back."
