"When attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced obstacles regarding laws, safety, and even the nature of the mast itself. There was a law at the time prohibiting aircraft from flying low over cities. In paragraph @NUM1, the narrator says, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". This did not stop some dirigibles from attempting it, but it was too dangerous around other buildings. The next obstacle was about safety. From the excerpt, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammible"". An incident like that with the Hindenburg over a city like New York would be devastating. The third obstacle was that the mast was simply not suited for holding a dirigible. The narrator points out, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". There was no practical way to hold the back end of the dirigible. In light of all these issues, builders were forced to admit that the mooring mast on the Empire State Building was indeed destined to fail."
