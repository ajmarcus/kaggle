"In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, there is a main mood created by the author. I think this mood is happiness. To Narciso and his whole entire family, family is the most important thing. No one leaves a family member out. In his neighborhood there mostly lived, Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. All these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. Narciso's parents came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. When I read this memoir I felt happy reading it. It let me know how other families who really have nothing, have everything. Narciso's family is very close, and caring for one another, and to them family is the only thing that matters."
