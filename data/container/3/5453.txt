"I think the author concluded the story with that phrase because it shows she will mature. She is saying that she was not ready for all the challenges she was going to face, For example she did not pass her test but instead of crying about it she just said I will take it again next year. In the story she also longed for her homeland, which she truley missed. She coped with this by buying a winter hibiscus to remind her not only of her homeland but also of her grandmother overall the main character showed depth and maturity throughout the piece."
