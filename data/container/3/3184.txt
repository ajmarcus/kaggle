"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A problem they faced was having to build the mooring mast because without it the derigible would add stress to the building's Frame. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings Frame."" Even though the builders made the mooring mass it was to unsafe to moore dirigibles from the building. ""The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles From outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable."" In all the builders were faced with to many obstacles and could not manage to moore the dirigibles to the building."
