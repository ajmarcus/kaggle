"The mood created by the author is warmth. First off, in paragraph two, it says how his family would always cook food and turn on the cuban music. It also says how the smell of the food would fill the house. In paragraph four, it says how they would always have family members over for dinner. Some of the family members they would have were Grandparents, Aunts, @CAPS1, and cousins. The last reason the mood is warmth is because he said in paragraph seven, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That means that before they lived there, it was just three rooms; however, once they moved in, they turned it into a place where friends and family could gather and have fun."
