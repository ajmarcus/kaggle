"The mood of the memoir is actually happy and grateful. I think this because the kid thanked his parents for letting them move to @LOCATION1 and all of them were happy that they took this sacrifice, Narciso especially. Narciso always thanks his mom and dad for thier bravery. He @CAPS1 he thanked them repeatedly and he could never have enough bravery to do that. That is how it is grateful. Something about the story has a very happy feel to it. Because the family is together and they are talking about how happy they are living with each other and even in @LOCATION1 it adds a very happy feel to it. That is what I think the author tried to create in the memoir."
