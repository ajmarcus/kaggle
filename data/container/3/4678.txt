"The setting of this story is a dry, hot desert in the middle of June. These features of the setting, effect the author, because it shows how he starts of strong + determained and his left weak + doubtful. In the begining of the story, the author says, Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face. This is showing the readers confidence he has with himself before starting his trip. Later on in the story, he discribes the setting as the high deserts of California in June. He is discribing the heat + what he is facing. It goes on to tell how he is dehydrated in worn out. But he comes to a town, ""cool water drippen from my head as I slumped against the wall."" @CAPS1 he is relieved. As the setting changes, the authors attitude changes as well."
