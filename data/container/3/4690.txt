"One ramsackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnt hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubled. There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. With any luck, Id hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. Rough road ahead if he didnt take the old mans advice, he would have enjoyed his bike ride he needed a new map."
