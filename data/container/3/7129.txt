"In this excerpt from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author sets a very clear mood in the memoir. Narciso Rodriguez's ""eternally grateful for his family and everything they did for him. For example, ""[Narciso Rodriguez] will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done."" @CAPS1 admires ""their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" @PERSON1 feels that ""there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" @PERSON1 ""learned the real definition of 'family.'"" @PERSON1 ""will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."""
