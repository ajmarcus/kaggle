"The builders of the empire state building where faced with multiple problems for their idea in for what the building would be used for.The first problem for the builders came up about the buildings frame. A thousand foot dirigible at the top of the building held by only one cable would cause to much stress to the buildings frame. the load of the dirigible and the wind would have to go to the buildings foundation, which was much to far below. The building would have to be modified costing over sixty thousand dollars in modifications. The architects made changes to the building to fit these needs. But again the architects we're presented with a problem. The mast of the building would cause problems that should have been spotted by the architects way befor construction. the biggest problem having to do with safety issues. most dirigible outside the country used hydrogen wich is highly flammable. There already had been an exsplosion one over New York could be to much."
