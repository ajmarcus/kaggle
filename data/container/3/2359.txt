"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by @PERSON1, the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. First of all, they needed a suitable landing area, which was a Mooring Mast. But before building the mast, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" Workers framed to the building all the way up to the 85th floor, But before the framing for the mast could take place, the roof had to be completed. Before advancing to the next stage of the project, the architects suddenly realized how dangerous and disasterous the result of it all could be. The ""Hindenburg"" set a good example on why they couldn't do it. The area around the building was too densely populated. The dirigible had a strong chance of resulting in a disaster over New York City, considering the violent air currents. The project was simply too risky, but was a great idea involving future transportation."
