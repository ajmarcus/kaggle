"During the process of building the Empire State Building, the builders had to go through obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on it. Some of these obstacles were changing the design of the building, thinking about the safety of people, and the material the dirigibles were made of. Since a thousand-foot dirigible that moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame, the steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened. Over sixty thousand dollars work of modifications had to be spent. A dirigible was a steel framed  balloon with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium. This was a safety issue; Most dirigibles used hydrogen, rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire, and the owners of the Empire State Building realzed how bad an accident like that could be over downtown New York. During construction of the Empire State Building, builders had to go through many obstacles just to attempt to allow dirigible to dock there."
