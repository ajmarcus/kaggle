"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting dirigibles to dock there include wind, weather, and especially safety issues. The excerpt states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This states that nature was a great obstacle for the plan of dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. The other largest obstacle was safety. The excerpt says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable."" Another main safety concern was that the use of lead weights to anchor the dirigible was neither practical nor safe above the city of pedestrians."
