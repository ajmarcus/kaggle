"The features of the setting in Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit greatly affect the cyclist. Im sure that the heat makes the cyclist more thirsty, and heat can also drain energy extremely fast. Being in the california desert in the middle of June does not sound like an enjoyable time to be riding a bike. When the cyclist got tired and exhausted from not having any water, Im sure that riding past all of the empty land had an effect on his attitude. I think that seeing a building made him get excited, and then when he found out that it was nothing more than an abandoned building, his spirits greatly dropped. He probably felt that he couldnt continue for very much longer simply because all of the buildings he came across were empty, or abandoned. When the cyclist reached the bait store, he probably felt much better, and very relieved to have gotten there before he had a heat stroke."
