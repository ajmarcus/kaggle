"The features of the setting affect the cyclist. First, the river and the pine trees The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them"". Thinking about that helped the cyclist keep going. Second, the road was getting harder to travel. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" and a sign on another road said rough road ahead The roads made the cyclist work harder to get to Yosemite National Park. Finally, the cyclist's water supply was running low. the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing  sips. Not having a lot of water is really bad when your outside in the heat and the cyclist had no idea where to find more. The towns the cyclist ran into were abandon or ghost town. The cyclist had nowhere to go to get help. This cyclist faced many problems during his bike ride to Yosemite national park."
