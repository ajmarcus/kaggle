"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, the architect and builders have to overcome very big obstacles while trying to make this plan of docking dirigibles work. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of this building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" With this enormous dirigible in the air and the wind blowing around would hurt the buildings structure."" The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" With all of the wind the dirigible would be tugging back and forth on the building. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" @CAPS1 to build a docking station the architects would have to transform the whole construction of the building."
