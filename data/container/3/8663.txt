"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" Narciso tells all about his parents and how greatful he is. Narciso created a mood during this memoir, he talked about his mom and dad and how they created his house into a home. Narciso's parents sacrificed a lot to move to @LOCATION1 and give their children a good life, even if it meant them having to leave behind family, friends and careers. The mood created overall was that I felt thankful for my home and family here in @LOCATION1. Then I also felt sympathy for Narciso's parents for leaving everything behind for their children. they also had to leave behind family, which is very hard to do. Narciso's parents made a very tough but wise deisicon but in the end it was worth it."
