"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First the building had a flat roof and a dirigible moored to the top, only held by a single cable tether would add stress to the buildings frame. Modifications to the building would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Other problems the building faced had to do with safety. Some dirigibles used hydrogen which is highly flammable and if an accident were to happen in New York it would be disastrous. The greatest obstacle was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting and even tethered to the mooring mast, the ship would not be secured. This was also very unsafe. The Empire State Building never succeeded it's purpose."
