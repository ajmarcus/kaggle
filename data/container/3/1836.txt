"Some of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were mainly weather and safety. In paragraph @NUM1 the author says ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This means that because of the wind and air currents always shifting the the dirigibles would be hard to control. Another obstacle they faced was safety. Also in paragraph @NUM1 the author says ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights... where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street..."" @CAPS1 that means is having something heavy dangling above people is not a good idea. It wouldn't be a good idea because if the weight would of disconnected from the dirigibles there is a possibility that somebody could get injured badly. Those obstacles are @CAPS1 builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock."
