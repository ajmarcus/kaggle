"In the construction of the Empire State building the @CAPS1 faced plenty of problems before and after the making of the mast. There were laws preventing the docking of the dirigibles, incidents that had occured, and flaws in safety. The first problem they should have turned their attention to was the law against low-flying aircraft over urban areas. It is said that ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up or even approach the area."" Another problem faced was the burning of the Hindenburg. The U.S. used helium to keep their dirigibles afloat while other countries were using highly-flammable hydrogen. This posed a big threat and @CAPS1 eiven started to wonder ""how much worse that incident would be if it had taken place above a densely populated area like downtown New York. The final problem was how un-safe it was to have a dirigible swaying in the intense winds near the building. The cargo would send the dirigible out of control in these winds. The mast on the Empire State Building had too many problems for the @CAPS1 to solve. It would never make it from the start."
