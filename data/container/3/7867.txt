"In the memoir written by @PERSON1 the author created a mood, that shines throughout the story. The mood represents the hapiness in @LOCATION3's life when he lived in a three room apartment Newark, New Jersey. In paragraph two, the author talks about how his parents used their heritage of Cuba and brought it to their new home in the United States. @PERSON1 was always greatful how his whole house was revolved around the kitchen. There was always Cuban music and the smell of a Cuban fiest in the air. @PERSON1 was always happy because he was always a part of a family. Through out the tough times @PERSON1's parents went through there was never a shortage of love or the feeling of family. In paragraph six, the author says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" When the author says this, it creates a happy mood, and it flows through out the memoir. Also in paragraph seven he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This memoir shows that the importance of family and friends creates a positive feeling in anyone's life."
