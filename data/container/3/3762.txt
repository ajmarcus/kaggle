"The settings have a huge affect on the cyclist. When he first comes to the @CAPS1 town he isnt really warried he is kind of laughing and thinks his funny by saying. This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time  - say, before the last world war. Then after he says that it ways he chuckled. When he gets the dark in the road with the risky pipe of water he begins to switch into conservation made and begins to get is scared. He says. I would comer  water- a test at my inner spirit  This showing that he was scared. After he sees the abanoned Grape juice factory he says something like birds are going to pick him clean and leave behind same expensive biking gear. This definatly shows that he is giving up. Another thing that would back this up is when he talks about writing in his diary about the old men who gives him these direction. When he finally reaches the balt shop he is releved and goes to the bathrom and drinks water. He  also says that he will buy bait even though he doesnt have a rod. These examples show the many ways the setting affected the cyclist."
