This exert explain the hot, arid climate of where he was cycling. This climate decreased the rate of travel the cyclist intended to exert. Since the cyclist was riding in the desert, there wasn’t many towns present. When the cyclist did approach a town, it was abandoned. “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me” (@NUM2).
