"The story of “Winter Hibiscus” is a prolonged metaphor for both connections to a comforting past as well as expectance and the future. Saeng misses her homeland but she must learn to adapt to her circumstances, and pass her drivers test. The story is nicely concluded with Saeng's promise to herself that come spring, she will take the test again. The hibiscus flower itself generates this promise as it gives her some closure and alleinates some home-sickness. Saeng’s promise indicates that she is comng to terms with her situation. When she sees the Canada geese flying, she has somewhat of an epiphany about the seasons. “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become.. - Almost familiar to her now.” I feel that was a landmark for Saeng and the conclusion illustrates that by allows to change."
