"The mood of the author is a very gental yet very happy tone. The reason it's gental is because he's describing how he grew up and what his life was like. To some people, they could just blab all day, but to most they have to dig through memories so that they can get the sceen just right. For example, ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen.""     @CAPS1 the parts were the mood was very happy was probably parts that he could remember the most with detail. For example, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today."" The reason that he could remember this more clearly is because he probably cooks for his family using his parents resipies."
