"The cyclist had experienced some hard obstacles on his ride to Yosemite. He had gotten directions from a group of old men who hadent gone the places they told him about in a long time. Where they said there would be a town it was more like a ghost town. The day that the cyclist was riding was very hot and he was riding through the desert, @CAPS1 made it worse. Because of the heat he was drinking his water regularly to stay hydrated. This meant he was running out of it fast since the old men had given him directions through places that were no longer open he couldnt get more water. The cyclist also had to go over roads that were in bad condition @CAPS1 slowed him down even more. Those features at the setting affected the cyclist a lot on his trip."
