"The mood created by the author in this memoir was really grateful and that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative (paragraph @NUM1). Also, it shows how grateful he his about his family because in paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" This shows that he is really happy and grateful for what he has and that he actually realizes how many sacrifices they did for him and how much they love him"
