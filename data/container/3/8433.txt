"In the passage ""Narciso Rodriguez from home: the blueprints of our lives,"" written by Narciso Rodriguez @CAPS1 ponders, and re-memmorates past events about his parents home in Newark, New Jersey. The author creates a suttle, but happy memory in the passage.                                                                                                                            The first reason to why the mood is a suttle, but happy one would be because their are serious parts of the passage, and happy parts of the passage. In paragraph four Narciso recalls having a lot of his family members living near his familys his house. When @CAPS1 says, ""Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary also all lived nearby and regulary joined us at our table."" @CAPS1 refers to the supper table when @CAPS1 says, ""our table."" The mood gets suttle when @CAPS2 talks about being greatfull to his parents for coming to @CAPS3 as immigrants with no working knoledge of @CAPS4 language, or writing. @CAPS1 also says in paragraph five, ""to give their children a better life."" @CAPS5 these are many terrific details to explain the mood that Narciso is trying to put into this passage."
