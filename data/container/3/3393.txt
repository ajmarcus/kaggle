"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there in the @NUM1.The first obstacle was ""the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" If the builders had decided to that than the dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame which could also jeopardize the lives of all the tourists who visited and everyone who worked there.There was also the fact that ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Which meant the frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened, something like that didn't come cheap, in fact ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework.""In all the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a failure. The most obvious being safety since most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The end result is, today the rooms that were set aside for baggage are now the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden. And the highest observation deck has never been open to the public."
