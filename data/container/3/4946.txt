"The features of the setting in, Rough Road Ahead negatively affect the cyclist. In the California desert, water is everything. If you run out of water then you might as well have run out of life. Without water, dehydration kicks in and it affects not only your body, but your mind too. The cyclist only had a limited amount of water with him when he started. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. Through the deserted towns he came across, he searched for a source of water but found none that were useable. When I tried a drop or two ,it had the flower of battery acid. @CAPS1 feature was the heat. It began to mess with his mind and take toll on his body quickly. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasnt a mirage He worned about heatstroke and his bodys need for water throughout the entire trip. Finally, in the deserts of California, wildlife can affect you. The cyclist was using a path that nature had claimed  and was not traveled often by people  crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement. As you can see, the cyclist was negatively afftected by the features of the setting in, Rough Road Ahead."
