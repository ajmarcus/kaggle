"During the @DATE1's Dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. Dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles per hour, and cruise at about seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles. The main obstacle that the Dirigibles would face in landing in New York City was the lack of suitable landing area. Another obstacle the architects and empire state builders faced was designing a mast that could allow the Dirigible to dock to the building, and also allowing people in and out of vehicle. Architects knew that they couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. ""An A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" so architects had to reconstruct the building's foundation to strengthen the structure of the building. The greatest obstacle that the Empire State builders faced was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The violent air currents at the top of the empire state building would make it dangerous and unsafe for Dirigibles to dock with the building."
