"The author concludes the story the way she does because it shows that Saeng   needs to heal from the failing of the test before she can take it again. Saeng already knows that she  can heal. She realizes that she has gotten used to where she now lives, that things in her new land, like the sound of geese, are now “familiar to her”. The narrator of the story says, “..she  realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become… almost familiar to her now.” Things in Saeng new home had been strange to her at first, but she had healed and gotten used to them. Saeng has also healed from leaving her original home of Vietnam. She was sad to leave her home, “ A work so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her.”, but she had healed. Saeng  remembers the flowers that she had known in vietnam as “old friends”, showing that it did not hurt her to remember them. When Saeng heals from failing   her driving test, like she had healed when moving  from Vietnam to the united states, she can re-visit the test, without pain."
