"The success of the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was prevented by many obstacles. Safety was one of the greatest reasons because ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen was flammable."" @CAPS1 starting in a densely populated city like New York could damage a lot of people. Nature also proved to be an obstacle because ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the dirigible to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" that was neither practical nor safe. It would also be difficult to control the dirigible once it is tied to the mast because of the violent motion that the dirigible is in. There was also an existing law ""against airships flying too low over urban areas"". This law made it illegal for any dirigible to even get near the mooring mast or tie to it. All of these obstacles were faced by the builders of the mooring mast, which eventually led to the disregarding of the idea of using the mooring mast for ships."
