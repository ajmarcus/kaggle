"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy thankful mood. The why it is a happy thankful mood is for the reason why he talk's about his family and how they sacraficed so much just for him. For example; ""They came selflessly, as many immigrant's do, to give their children a better life, even though it ment leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country the loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardship."" @CAPS1 thing is that he also learned what family really means. For example; ""I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many thing's I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parent's turned this simple house into a home."""
