"@CAPS2 on the excerpt, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" This would cause stress on the building, so the ""steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" Another obstacle the architects faced was a concern of safety. In the excerpt it says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" @CAPS1 the greatest obstacle was ""nature itself."" On the top of the building, the winds were constantly shifting because of the violent air currents. In the excerpt it states, ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" @CAPS2 on the excerpt, these are the many obstacles faced by the architects."""
