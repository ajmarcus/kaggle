"The reason why the  author concludes the story with that paragraph is because it shows that saeng is starting to expect the new place she is in. Throughout  the story it says how she feels out of place just like the  winter hibiscus. Then later in the story she says how ,many of the things that she thought of as strange before had become , through quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now . That quote means that most things she thought of as strange she is now getting used to slowly, which means is adapting. So, the reason why she says the last paragraph is to show that when everything changes back to spring the geese come back, and the hibiscus is budding ,then she will take that test again.therefore  the author puts the conclusion on the story because it shows how  she will adapt as well as the hibiscus.
