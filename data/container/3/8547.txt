"Mood was created by the author in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez."" The mood that he creates is a happy and proud mood. The author is happy to have had a wonderful family and was proud of what his family accomplished and proud of his home. Also the environment of were he was growing up taught him that ""family had nothing to do with being a blood relative. He sets a happy mood because of how he thinks of his whole community as a family. He was very proud of his mother and father. For example he says ""they came selflessly, as immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" And he also says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This is the mood I think that the author created in the memoir."
