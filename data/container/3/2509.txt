The builders of the Empire state building faced countless problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main problem is safety. Even though the dirigibles was going to be hooked on top of the building the wind could potentially whip the dirigible to crash into the building. Also after the crash of the Hindenburg the builders realized how much damage could be done if that were to happen in New York. Another problem they faced is the laws. The law prohibited any aircraft flying too low over urban areas. These problems caused this idea to disappear.
