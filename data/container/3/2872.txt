"In the excert The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example One big problem they faced was the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state building's flat roof."" This operation would not be possible because ""A thousand  foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings foundation, wich is nearly 11 hundred feet below."" the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new sittoation. One big obstacle they faced was a big Safety problem. ""Most dirigibles from outside the @CAPS1 used @CAPS2 drogen rather than @CAPS3 lium, and @CAPS2 drogen is very flammable. the biggest obstacle to face was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights but using them at the empire state building, were they would be hanging on top of padestrans on the street was neither practical nor safe. These are the obstacles the empire stat building faced."
