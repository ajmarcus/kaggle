"The builders faced many obstacles when trying to build the empire state building. First of all for it to be a @NUM1 ft building it would have to have a very strong base to support it and they had to reinforce the base too to be able to mount the mooring mast on top. They also faced issues with the strong air currents that flowed above New York. None of the dirigibles were able to dock because of the high current. The mooring mast also placed stress on the frame. ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" this proves proves how much difficulty the builders were going to have with the construction of the Empire state building."
