"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obsticles attempting to allow dirigibles also known as blimps to dock there. some of these obstacles faced by the builders were that the architecs could not drop a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. Attaching a thousand-foot dirigible to the top of the building's frame ""would add stress to the building's frame."" @CAPS1 in paragraph @NUM1. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly @NUM2 feet below"". Also it was very unsafe allowing the highly flamable dirigible to coast over a highly populated area. Lastly the article states ""the greatest obsticle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The ship would ""swivel"" around the mooring mast. Dirigibles should be landing in open fields, where they could not dangle above pedestrians."
