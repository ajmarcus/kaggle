"The mood of this memoir is that @PERSON1 is happy being with his family because he believes you should always love your family.                                                                                                                                                   Growing up in his environment instilled in him a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative, but his neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. At this time racism, and segregation prevailed in the United States. Despite customs elsewhere, all the cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.                                                                                                                                      It was a closeknit community of hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who were not necessarily their own kind, but were clearly in need of a helping hand.                                                                            The mood of this story is that everyone can come together in happiness and joy."
