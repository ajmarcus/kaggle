"Throughout this memoir the mood was very realistic. While I was reading it I was very interested in what Narciso had to say next. It seemed as if he was extremely happy to be at where he's @CAPS1. From his speech in this story I can tell that his personality is very outgoing and he likes to look back at where he used to be, and where he is now, and all the sacrifices that have been made throughout his lifetime. He is a very grateful child. Another mood in the story was happiness, along with unity. Naciso quotes ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" Just by reading this quote you can clearly see that Narciso is very grateful. He also quotes ""But, In reality There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important my friends and family are to me."" @CAPS2 reader, there you have it. Those are the two main quotes throughout this memoir explaining the mood of the set!"
