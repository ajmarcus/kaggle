"People make sacrafices for the ones they love. That is called being selfless. In the story, Narciso's parents are selfless. They left their family and friends to give their son a better life. The author makes an enjoyable and heartwarming mood.Narciso is very greatful. He said he has ""learned the definition of 'family' "". His parents wanted a better life for him. They gave up a lot and he recognize that. Rodriguez realized his parents were very hardworking. He respected his parents and loved them for everything they have done for him. ""I often tell them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" It's a great feeling knowing someone will do anything for you.Family is very important. @PERSON1 mentioned how his neighbors were all immagrants. They had left their family, too; and only had eachother. Knowing you have people who are like family is incredible. Although they can never replace blood relatives, friends are the next best thing. I think growing up, @PERSON1 learned to very important lessons. Put others before yourself, and work hard."
