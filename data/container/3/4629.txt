"The setting in the essay Rough Road Ahead makes the bikers travel a very difficult challenge that he has to overcome. When the flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills, the biker must use more energy to peddl up the hills. This made it hard on him to overcome his exauhtion of physical endurance. Also, he states that he was traveling through the high desert of California in June this weather is very hot and dry, therefor causing him to quickly run low on water. And, because he was in the desert, there was no sign of towns or people or salvation of any type. These conditions made it hard on the biker because he knew if he dropped from dehydration, no one would be around to save him. In conclution, these hard conditions challenged the bike a great deal."
