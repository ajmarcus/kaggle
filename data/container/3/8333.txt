"In the memoir, the author creates a loving mood. I think he creates a loving mood as opposed to something else because of the way he describes and explains things. For example, when he is describing his parents cooking. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air,"". The phrases in parenthesis portrait to me a loving mood. Another part of the memoir that really portraits to me a loving mood is the way the author describes this community and his parents sacrifice is shown by these next to quotes ""it was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need"", ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially,"". The detail and emotions he uses in those quotes makes the mood a loving mood for  all the author gives a great and loving mood in this memoir."
