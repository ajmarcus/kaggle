"This excerpt called ""Narciso Rodriguez"" written by Narciso Rodriguez, he sets a light, happy mood. I say this because throughout the whole story, he is describing all the good things about his parents and his household during his childhood. A few examples are in paragraph @NUM1, where Rodriguez states ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family"". When he says this, it gives the reader a good feel of how his parents cared for anyone who needed their help. In paragraph @NUM2, Rodriguez says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" When he says this, it is another time he is telling us he is grateful for his family. Throughout the whole excerpt, Rodriguez lists many times he was happy and grateful for everything his parents have done for him, which sets a positive mood."
