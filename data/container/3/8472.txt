"The author of the memoir created the mood very well. The mood in the memoir was very warm and happy. There were many ways the author created the mood. One way he created it was by saying that at that time, overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. And then he said his neighborhood was made up of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants and despite the different customs all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.Another way the author created the mood was by telling us how caring his parents were. He does this when he tells us about how when ever someone was in need, they would let them stay at their house.'""The next way the author creates the mood is when he says my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us.Those are some ways the author created the mood in the story."
