"One of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was that the construction of the mooring mast would add stress to the building due to its height. The architects, however, were able to design a special type of stainless steel that would be illuminated from the inside and provide support. Another obstacle was that the dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and having such an airship with flammable gas nearby civilization was considered unreasonable. Thus, a law was passed that forbid the transportation of dirigibles close to the public. Nature was also against the architects, and so posed a safety hazard when high-speed winds attempted to @CAPS1 the dirigibles from the sky while being weighed down with lead weights. In the end, the mooring mast on the Empire State Building was never used due to these issues."
