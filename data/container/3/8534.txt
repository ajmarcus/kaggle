"The mood created in the memoir is I think comfort and happiness. First in paragraph @NUM1 ""Here, the innocence of childhood the congregation of family and friends the endless celebrations."" These all make people happy childhood, family, friends and partys, so its no wonder that I think the memoir is happy. Also in paragraph @NUM2 ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family knowing that they would do the same for us."" This puts a smile to my face that people are so giving to others when they don't have to, I hope it brings a smile to you to. Last in paragraph @NUM3 ""filled the air with not just sent and music but life and love."" when I read this I think of nothing bad jut a family singing, laughing and all by a warm cozy fire place. It brings me comfort. Over all thats why I think the memoir is comforting and happy,"
