"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that of gratefulness and happiness. The memoir show a pasionate explination of how Narciso Rodriguez's parents Came to the land of @LOCATION1. It shows how happy he is that he can live in @LOCATION1, and lead his own life. He is, and will always be, eternally grateful that his parents brought him here, so he could have a better life. His gratefulness also affects how his parents raised him, as a Cuban. Any mood could have been described here, but, as it states in the memoir, he is grateful for his family."
