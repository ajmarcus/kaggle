"The mood of the memoir is appreciation. I think it's this mood because in the final paragraph the author says, ""... I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" @CAPS1 fact is, in paragraph @NUM1, @PERSON1 talks about how he kept thanking his parents for everything he had. He states, ""I've often told them that what they did is a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" I guess he is just very grateful for his parents, his childhood, everything and everyone he has ever met, had or done in his life. If I were in his shoes, I'd be grateful, too. This opened my eyes and now, I, too, am grateful for everything and everyone I have in my life."
