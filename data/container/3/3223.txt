When the empire state building was faced with @CAPS1 a dirigible docking station they encountered many Problems. The first @CAPS2 the @CAPS3 encountered was the wind. The wind over a thousand feet in the air is never going to be @CAPS4. Once they got the dirigible @CAPS5 to the tower there would be no way they Could keep it still enough to refule and let passangers on or off the dirigible. The Second @CAPS2 they ran into was helium is flammable. If somehow that helium @CAPS7 fire it would be @CAPS8 in such a Place as downtown New York. The third and final reason is it is illegal to have an aircraft that low in a city. There was no way this was going to work out so they stopped moving forward on this @CAPS9.
