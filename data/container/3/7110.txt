"In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, the mood and feeling of her home and comunity is a happy and heartwarming situation. Most people who would live in a tiny apartment in the city would say that it was to small and cramped, while they wished for a mansion on the ocean, but Narciso was perfectly happy being in that environment. The way she described it, there were always great smells, wounderful music, and great people around all of the time. Narciso said the man people who contributed the most to her wounderful experience in New Jersey were her parents. They supported and cared for her at the same time they were strugling for money. They never showed sadness and they loved and cared for her. Even though Narciso lived in a small apartment in the city, she and her family show that you can make the best out of any situation."
