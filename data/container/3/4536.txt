"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they started to mess with her mind. She didnt knew where she was and on hip of that got lost. Whether you see nothing around. You or alot around you, youre going to feel scared. They have the same affect. In the authors case, she was cycling and didnt/couldnt and water. This is an over whelming feeling because you can die from dehydration. She then kept cycling and saw nothing. no one insight; not a building, car, or structure of any kind. That is alatining no water or people around, as if you are going to be just left to die. These settings would affect anyone who came across them. They dffinately affected the cyclist because she was by herself, and on her dvun. Plus, all she had was a map, her bike and an empty water bottle."
