"In the memoir of @PERSON1, the author shows a lot of mood throughout the story. Happy and grateful stand out as the two most important moods.      @PERSON1 is very grateful throughout the memoir. He is grateful of his friends and family. His caring and selflessness parents. Also all of the hard work they do and what they gave up back in Cuban in order to come to @LOCATION1. His dad worked in the laboratory and his mom studied chemichal engineering. Lastly he is grateful to have grown up in a really good home.          Another mood is happiness. In the first paragraph parenthesis mean that he really enjoys cooking and Cuban music. He is also very proud about his Cuban @CAPS1 and how his extended family stays with him.            This memoir has a lot of mood in it and it makes it a lot better."
