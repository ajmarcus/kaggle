"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The biggest obstacle was finding a safe way to do it. New York City is a very densely populated area so any type of accident would be horrific, as the owners realized in @CAPS2 @NUM1, ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse that accident couldve been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as @CAPS1."" Another obstacle was nature itself. The wind at the top of the building was too strong as it says in @CAPS2 @NUM2, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currants. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast."" Safety was clearly the biggest concern"
