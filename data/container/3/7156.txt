"the mood was definatly uplifting and happy. at first when he describes his ""house"" he says within these walls my young parents treated our traditional cuban ""home"". You see how he goes from house to home that then you know is a happy place for them. with their kitchen as the ""heart"" (happy heart) cuban music fills the air/ (which he adores). this is just a verry uplifting story how he was born into a cuban, Spanish, Italian people dealt with racism and his parents are welcoming in their extended big extended family  into sleep eat everything. this is a good family and like he said family is not about being blood related its about loving them the way they come and still be in their homes. their family is without a worry all about love and courage his parenths taught him something special and how you can have more than a blood related family. All you need is a little selfishness and alot of courage."
