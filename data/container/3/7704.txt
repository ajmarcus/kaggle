"The author of Narciso Rodriguez creates an enjoyably, happy, fun mood.  The author makes every little sentence sound like you actually lived there & or were there at some point. The whole second paragraph is wonderfully written it makes me feel like I honestly was the experiencing his home & the love & kindness of his home. The love & friendship @CAPS1 shared with the people of his neighborhood is also shown in that same paragraph & as well as the other ones too. @CAPS1 shows so much love & thanks to his family & friends & his whole entire neighborhood in his last paragraph. Yet most of all to his parents in his last sentence. ""I will never forget how my parent turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 also especialy shows how hard his parents worked to stay up but still did so much to care for everyone else, all right in paragraph @NUM1."
