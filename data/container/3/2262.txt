"The Empire State Building faced numerous problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The most important reason was the safety of the people. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium to power their dirigibles and hydrogen is extremely flammable The death toll would be astronaumical over a dense population as downtown New York. Another obstacle faced in this creation was nature. The winds at the top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting and the idea of a dirigible dangling high above pedestrians was not safe. The last reason that the dirigibles were not safe was the existing law in the U.S. At the time of the building of the Empire State Building, a law existed that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Therefore, the dirigible was to close to the ground and was not allowed to dock. The idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building is a phenomenal idea, however, there are to many obstacles prohibiting it."
