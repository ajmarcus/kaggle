"The mood of this memoir is very happy and loving. Throughout the story Narciso shows how much he apreciates that his parents gave him the oportunits to grow up in @LOCATION1. He shows to me that this in memoir is loving by explaining how his mom and dad always had there arms and dores open to any body they considered family. The memoir is happy because it shows that he has a lot of good relations with many people that he calls family. He is also happy because he knows how much it takes to move from your home country to @CAPS1. Overall Narciso had a very happy, loving childhood."
