In paragraph three it states ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This shows that he considered people around him family and not just his blood relatives. He shows this by talking about how his surrogate grandparents lived in the basement and he didn't know his real grandparents until 1970 when they were allowed to leave cuba. He is always grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. The whole memoir is about love, family which sets a positive mood for the reader."
