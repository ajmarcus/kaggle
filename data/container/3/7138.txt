Another mood that is in the memoir is careing. In paragraph @NUM1, it says ""there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" This shows that even though the authors family had a small home they let people stay with them untill they could leave. The last mood in the memoir is happiness. In paragraph @NUM3, it says ""I celebrated my first birthdays. Mood it was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast alwase filled the air."" The author explains how he had his birthday with his friends and family. These are only three of the main moods in the story."
