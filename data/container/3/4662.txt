"Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. First, he was in high desert of California in June. This affected him many ways. It makes him become very dehydrated. He had to conserve his water and chew on pebbles to get any spit to collect in his mouth. Also, the road became very rough. The new terrain made him has to push himself harder and lose energy quicker. The last feature would be the distance. He had to travel a lot further then he had planned to. This again affected his energy and spirits with thoughts of possible death, and not be able to make it. Those are how just some of the features of the setting affected the cyclist."
