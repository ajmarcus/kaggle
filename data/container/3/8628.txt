"In this memoir the mood varies. In paragraphs three and four it was a ""giving"" mood, for example explained in paragraph four ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" It shows right in the sentence that they gave people in need what they needed in difficult times. In paragraphs six and seven the mood was thankful and happy for the sacrifice his parents gave for him. Because of her future. In paragraphs one and two the mood is happy and comfy because she is happy about her home, her family and the love she has been given in her life. These are the various moods in the memoir."
