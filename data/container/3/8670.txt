"In the excerpt of the memoir Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by @PERSON1, the mood created is one of love for family and friends. The author explains his parents reasons for immigrating with such love and devotion that it is hard to not feel the same way. The author describes how everyone would eat together and they often had many more people eating with them. The author says ""...countless extended family members came and went..."" and then continues on to describe how his family lets other family members come stay with them until they get back on their feet. The author really shows the mood of the excerpt in a loving way and does this the most when saying you will always be grateful to his parents for moving to @LOCATION1 for him. The author shows that he truely cares about his family."
