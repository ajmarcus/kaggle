"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir is very thankfull and happy. Narciso does a very good job of show his moods, like when he says, ""Growing up in this environment it instilled me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative."" Here, you can tell that the mood is happy because the way he says how his family would welcome anyone into their family, but It also shows that if you grow up in a good family environment, you're also going to want to invest those lessons into your own kids lifes. Another example of mood is the last sentence, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" Not only does it show again that what you learn when you are little you always want for your family, but also shows that you cannot call a house a home till you are able to live their with your family and the home always have a good mood in it. In the end, the mood in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, reflects the proper, but not only way, to have a good mood in your home."
