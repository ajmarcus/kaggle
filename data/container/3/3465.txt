"In the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on it. When building the Empire State Building the architects had to take the height.. of the building and mooring mast into account. They simply could not drop a large glass and chrome mooring mast on top of the buildings flat roof. Also the wind currents over one thousand feet high our rapidly changing. An extremely large dirigible board at the top of the building would ""add stress to the buildings frame"".

But alas, the mooring mast of the empire state building never fufilled its destiny due to these obstacles."
