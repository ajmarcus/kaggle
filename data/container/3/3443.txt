"The builders of the Empire State Building faced @CAPS1 obstacles in allowing Dirigibles to dock. The most blatant one was the height at which they would dock. Al Smith states ""The Empire State would reach the height of @NUM1 feet,"" @CAPS1 Dirigibles from outside the U.S. Were extremly Flammable. If one caught fire while moored to the top of the Empire state building the results would have been catastrophic because it would happen over a densly populated area. Another obstacle was wind. If the ship was tethered to the mast the back of it would constantly Swivel around. USing led weights to secure the back would not be safe or practical. The last one was a law that made flying a dirigible too low over a urban area illegal. No Ship would be allowed to fly over downtown New York."
