"The Empire State Building face a lot of obstacles like in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This was one of the many trouble there was for dirigibles to land on the Empire State building. In paragraph @NUM2, They @CAPS1 to realize that the mooring mast of the @ORGANIZATION1n't of been build, because it wouldn't work."" The Mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfil it's purpose, for reason that should have been apperent before it was ever constructed. The reason that mooring mast was because of nature. As you will see on paragraph @NUM3, ""the Wind were shifting due to violent air currents."" The mooring mast had a lot of problems scinc the beginning when Al Smith put a top to the building making it 1,250. It was unsafe for planes. When they wanted to make the Dirigibles land on top of the building. Dirigibles that came from another countries had hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The problem that worked anginst the mooring mast being buit was wind on top of the building @CAPS2. Because of the air currents. These are the reasons why the mooring mast was unsuccessful on the Empire State Building"
