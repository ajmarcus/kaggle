She said her parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love for cooking that is still me today. Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Which is kinda like a happy mood and "" Here, the innocence of childhood the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. Which is definatly a calm and happy mood."
