"There were many problems and obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as nature itself. At @NUM1 ft. the winds were just too strong and unpredictable to get close to and dock a dirigible. On top of nature, laws prevented the landing. Airships could not fly low over urban areas so even attempting to approach the area would be illegal. This idea still posed a great deal of potential danger even if there were no laws against it and wind didn't exist. Many dirigibles were made using hydrogen, which is highly flammable. In such a highly populated area as New York City if one were to catch fire the damage would be horrifying. I hope Al Smith was willing to pay thousands of dollars for the title of world's tallest building because he didn't get his mast"
