"As it was the idea of a dirigibles dock was quite far fetched THe first problem thay encountered was that having a thousand foot long dirigible attached to the empire state building would cause a great strain on the buildings framework, @CAPS1 they would have to change the structure of the entire building to strengthen its framework. The largest problem was a matter of safety. Dirigibles use hydrogen which is extremely flammable, also the author states ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" making the idea of a dirigibles dock extremly to risky. They should have been spotted before so much money was put into making this dock."
