The builders of the Empire @CAPS1 Building were faced with obstacles while attempting to allow derigibles to dock there. The architects realized they could not put the mooring mast on top of the building without modifying and strengthening the steel frame of the building. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would add too much weight to the framework which could cause it to collapse. They strengthened the framework from the bottom of the building to the top before putting the shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower on the top of the building. The builders were faced with these obstacles but they were successful in completing their goal. The mooring mast is not used as a docking station but it is still looked at as the final peice that makes the Empire State Building stand out above all buildings in downtown New York City.
