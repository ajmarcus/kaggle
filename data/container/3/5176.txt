"When the cyclist passed through the old towns the old man told him to, the setting played a big part in making his situation harder to overcome when he passed through the first abandoned town, the water source was dry and empty. The text says ""pumped the handle for several minutes but the water would not cool it tasted like battery acid. The second drink source he passed was on abandoned @PERSON1s Juice factory. The text says,a sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth. These two objects made his situation mentally harder to get through because he was so close to what he needed numerous times, then it was taken away."
