"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus provides comfort. @CAPS2 Saeng failed her driving test and was new to @LOCATION1, she was frustrated and was missing her real home in Vietnam. The hibiscus reminded her of her grandmother. She writes she closed her eyes and breathed in deeply as the fragrance filled her lungs after Saeng smelled the flower it reminded her of combing her grandmothers long grey hair, freshly washed it brought her comfort in a time of disappointment. @CAPS2 she didnt have her grandmother, the flower comforted her. Although she was disappointed the hibiscus was exquisite and as she said the @CAPS1 word dokor malik meaning hibiscus she savored the feel of the word on her tongue. @CAPS2 the joy and comfort is what the flower brings to Saeng, she will take the test again in the spring when the snow melts and the hibiscus is budding, thus bringing joy, love, and comfort to the reader as they feel what Saeng feels."
