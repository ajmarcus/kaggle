"I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph because that represents saengs decision to try again and to overcome obstacles in her way. It is used instead of her saying  I will try again next spring  to show diction and to show her goal or decision in a different way for example, It says , Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season almost familiar now. At first, geese flying in the sky was new to her, but now shes use to it. Maybe the author is making a reference to the geese since it will be familiar (the driving test) and she will pass like she got use to and familiar with geese. Since her family came to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam, shes been adjusting to changes in her life and to circumstances. But, Saeng seemed determined to survive and overcome it. The paragraph is saying simply that shell take the test again next spring, but the author put that paragraph there to show diction by emphasizing the geese, representing learning something new, and the hibiscus, something familiar. It overtones the point in the story, which is to not give up and the will to survive."
