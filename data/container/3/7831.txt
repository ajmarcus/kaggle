"In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, the author created a very thankful mood. When Narciso talks about his family's culture at home, he constantly tells us how much he sill loves it today. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air..."" (@CAPS1. @NUM1). Instead of just telling us that there was passionate Cuban music in his home as a child, he included the parenthasese to remind us that he still loves the music he used to listen to. This makes him sound very thankful that his parents played that music in his home. In addition to him giving us reasons to believe he is thankful, he tells us in his memoir that he constantly thanks his parents. ""I've thanked them repeatedly."" (@CAPS1. @NUM2). He tells us plainly that he thanks his parents, and that he is very thankful for what they did for him when he was a child. Finally, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" (@CAPS1. @NUM2) ends his memoir and proves to us how thankful he is. Only a person who is very thankful ""will never forget..."" something. Throughout Narciso's memoir, there is a very clear and constant mood of thankfullness."
