"The authors mood in the memoir @PERSON1 is thankful. I know this, because in paragraph @NUM1 @CAPS1 talks about his culinary skills and how grateful he is to have it passed down to him. This shows us that he is very much thankful for this skill, because some people don't know how to cook and to be able to cook is a blessing. This also shows us that he is proud of his culture and who he is as a person. @PERSON2 quotes ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice."" In @CAPS2, this shows us that @PERSON2 was very much appreciative of all that his parents had done for him. Also that he loved his parents dearly and every chance he gets, he thanks them. Therefore in the memoir Narciso gives off the mood of being thankful."
