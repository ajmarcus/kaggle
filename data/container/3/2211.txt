"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. By building a mooring mast, they had to make changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton. ""The steel frame of the building had been modified and strengthened"" in order for the mast to fit properly and remain stable and safe.        Another obstacle faced by the builders was creating a design that would allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. They were to tie the front of the aircraft to the building, however this didn't work out, because, as the author states, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" All in all, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempt to let dirigibles dock there."
