The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have had to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation which was @NUM1 feet below.  So the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened Another obstacle was that most dirigibles from outside the U.S use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.  The third obstacle was the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.  Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would move around uncontrollably.  Lastly, the last obstacle with the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.  This would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.
