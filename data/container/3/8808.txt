"In the memor from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez his mood is very meaning full. You can tell that what he's saying he really means it, he's senser. He say's ""my parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen"" in paragraph @NUM1 line @NUM2. In paragraph @NUM2 line @NUM4 he say's ""it was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immgrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need. Or when he tells us that his first friend was his babysitter @PERSON2 who was his land lords daughter. Narciso Rodriguez tells us how his parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family. in paragraph @NUM5 line @NUM6. He tells us in paragraph @NUM7 second line how his mother and father ""came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life"" even if it did mean leaving behind their loved ones, and things they loved. In the last sentence of his memor he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home.""With those last words you from Narciso Rodriguez you know that he is senser, about what he's saying and that he could never thank his parents for what they did for him."
