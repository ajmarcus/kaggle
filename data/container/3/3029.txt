"While building the Empire State Building, builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the greatest obstacles was safety. They would need to find a way to dock the dirigibles to the mast with out having it swing in the wind. ""Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (@NUM1). Another obstacle in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock the Empire State Building was designing the mast. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (@NUM2). The Empire State Building's steel frame had to be strengthened in order to withstand to weight of the mast."
