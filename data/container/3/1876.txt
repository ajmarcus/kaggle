"Through the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, we learned that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the summit of the building. Some of the obstacles that the builders faced in this enginering challenge are; @CAPS1 the builders faced the challenge of how the Empire State Building was going to be able to support the weight of these long aircrafts. We learned this in paragraph @NUM1 when the author states ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the buildings frame."" To overcome this problem ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened (@NUM2)."" It is later said that these modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another problem that the builders faced was, how safe docking a blimp would be in a highly populated area.  In paragraph @NUM3 we learned that most dirigibles are made of hydrogen, which is highly flammable. After ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey... The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" All in all in the excerpt The Mooring Mast will learned that the builders of the Empire State Building face many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the peak of the building."
