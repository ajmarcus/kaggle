"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author sets a certain mood. I think the mood created in this story is love. My reason for thinking this is that the story talks about how the parents sacrificed everything to move to the @LOCATION1 so they would have a better life and so would their children. Another reason why love is the mood is because he talks about how even though the people he spent his time with weren't his blood relatives, he still consider them all family. Lastly, I think love is the theme because he shows an undying gratitude towards his parents for his wonderful childhood and making the place he lived in feel like home. That is why I think the mood the memoir creates is love"
