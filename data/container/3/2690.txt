"In the story ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted, There were many problems to face to allow dirigibles to dock ontop of the empire state building. These obstacles composed of the dirigibles themselves, natures winds, and laws that prevent dirigibles being allowed to dock. Some dirigibles from outside the state used hydrogen, a flammable gas, and could cause mass destruction to New York City due to being about the same length as four blocks, in New York City."" Wind caused the dirigibles to swivel around even after being tied down. Since there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."", doing so could cause the captain of the dirigible to be arrested."
