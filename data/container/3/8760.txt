"I think the mood the author created in the memoir is love. Through the memoir, he talks about his parents immigrating, his new home, and people that were always at his house. This shows their love, and his parents' selflessness. He portrayed his parents as caring people and it seems like they showed love to everyone. Rodriguez says ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" They seemed to put other people before themselves, and to always surround themselves with people who they love, and to love them."
