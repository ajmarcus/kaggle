"The mood the author created in the memoir was happiness and satisfaction. I know this because in the story the main character is happy. As he arrives in New Jersey he enjoys how his parents create their house looking like a traditional Cuban home. He is passionate of the Cuban music that he adores listening too everyday. Another thing is that the main character is satisfied of what his parents do for him. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The last thing is that he is thankful to his parents because in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""@CAPS1 often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done. I've told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance and I've thank them repeatedly."" These are the moods the author created in the memoir."
