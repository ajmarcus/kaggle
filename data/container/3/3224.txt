"The @ORGANIZATION1 spire was originally built to be more than just visibly stimulating. The spire was actually a mooring mast to be used for docking dirigibles. Dirigibles, or blimps, were thought to be the transportation of the future, but the mast had many obstacles it had to overcome. Al Smith saw an opportunity to make the Empire State Building and all of New York on the fore front of modern travel. The mast would have to support and withstand a dirigibles weight so, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" The constant threat of wind made the plans too dangerous as well. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Finally, most dirigibles were highly flammable and couldn't be safely docked with at endangering the public. A disaster like that would have been much worse..."" if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Building a mooring mast on the empire state building and many obstacles involved."
