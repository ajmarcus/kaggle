"The mood  created by the author in the memoir shows a kind community, careful, and courage. My first quote is ""...hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need.""  The quote means the mood of the community is kind and helping. My second quote is ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family."" This quote means that his parents  mood was careful and do anything for people if they needed help. My third and last quote is ""My mother and father had came to this country with such courage."" This quote means like before they came to the United States they had courage and now they were going to make it and be successful.  Those are my three quotes and examples of the mood created by the auother in the memoir."
