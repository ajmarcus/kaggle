"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very grateful and kind for many reasons. Narciso Rodriguez he tells why his parents made a hard choice to come to @LOCATION1 and leave all their friends, family, and careers behind. He really shows the people who have read his memoir that he respects his parents and thanks them so much to make his life better in @LOCATION1. This memoir relates to people and real life. He explains where he comes from and he just loves the way he can live his life simple and be happy for what he had accomplished so far (and his parents). In his memoir the details and the description just makes you want to keep reading and learn more about his life. In conclusion, every-thing in the memoir is so kind and precious to him."
