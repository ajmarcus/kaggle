"The cyclist in Rough Road @CAPS1; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit starts off in the serenity of an easly summer evening taking road advice from old-timers. At first when the sun was beating down on him, he didnt mind; the thoughts of Yosemite kept him determined. Later however, his determination was fading as he realized that his short cut was not so short after all. The high deserts of California in June and the terrain changed furthered his dehydration and need to find water. The emptiness of his surrounding with no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind made him focus on the horizon and tell himself that if he made it there, the hed be alright. Finally, a building came into view. The hope he got from this gave him strength to move on. Ironically it was an abandoned building. The cyclist describes it as a Welchs Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. @CAPS2 this he had lost hope and hung his head. Believing he was going to die, the cyclist got back on his bike. Driving away from the factory, he saw a sight of a fish camp and immediately regained hope. Going there, he regained his strength and learned his lesson, never take road advice from other people.  "
