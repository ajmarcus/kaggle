"In the memoir @ORGANIZATION1 gives a loving and caring mood to the readers. I think this because whe he describes certain things, like his parents, he would add a loving and caring feeling. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will never foreget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That sentence indicates how much he Loved his parents for doing that. Also in paragraph @NUM2 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" that indicates how apriciative he was. Also this memoir gives a grateful and thankful mood because it makes you think about the people and family members that had loved and sacrificed for you. That is why I think the memoir @ORGANIZATION1 gives off loving and caring mood to the readers."
