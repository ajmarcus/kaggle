"Architects designing the Empire State Building with the intent of docking zeppelins to it at heights of over @NUM1 feet no doubt had a lot to go through. According to ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, obstacles included adding stress to the buildings frame with a blimp attached, and the design of the mooring mast itself. The article says that ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"" in order to make docking safe. The mooring mast was composed mostly of steel. Other problems facing architects was the wind factor, and keeping zeppelins immobile in the ""constantly shifting"" and ""violent air currents"" at @NUM2 feet. Safety hazards also came into account, because architects realized that should another accident like the Hindenburg's occur again in New York City, results could be disastrous. As such, the Empire State Building's mooring mast for zeppelins never went into operation."
