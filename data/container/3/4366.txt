"In the short story Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit by @PERSON1, a cyclist travels through an extreme climate and tough terrain that nearly end his life to get to his destination. After getting outdated directions from some elderly locals, the protagonist sets off on his journey to Yosemite National Park. Soon thereafter, the cyclist notices something is amiss. The first town the locals said hed find is deserted. And now, twenty miles into his journey, the cyclist needs to refill some of his water supply. The water pump there has the flavor of battery acid. With the next town @NUM1 miles away, the cyclist struggles to conserve his water to make it there. Even then, things get worse. As he is, traveling through the high deserts of California in June, flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. @CAPS1 tell him not to exceed the speed limit of @NUM2 as he does a water-depleting @NUM3. eventually, even on his few sips of water, the cyclist finds a spot to fill up on water, knowing now to strike out on better days and better directions."
