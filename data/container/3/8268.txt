"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author explains the true meaning of family and home. The mood is extremely deep and pearsonal as he describes the love and selflessness his family expressed. He explains that his mother and father emigrated from Cuba and moved to @LOCATION1 so that Narciso, their son, would have a better, successful life. Reading this memoir, I can picture Narciso getting very emotional expressing how grateful he is for his parents and family. He explains, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home"" (@NUM1). This sentence and last few paragraphs change the mood a great deal. It went from happy, appreciation, and an explanation of his life to deep, incredibly personal, and to his complete thoughts. Narciso had a great love and admiration for his family and friends like most people should be able to experience like Narciso writes about in his memoir."
