"After reading Do not Exceed Posted Limit I have seen how the scene of an area can effect your mood and attitude around things. In this story, the main character is a cyclist who takes the advice of a few old men sitting in a poseh who tell him a bad shortcut. As he is riding, he comes across some hills.
