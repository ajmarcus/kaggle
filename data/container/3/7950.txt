"This memoir gives me a sort of cozy and comfortable feeling. When it talks about a family being not only people that are blood-related to you I think of my friends and the people I can count on. They are my family too. He also talks about how a house is not necessarily a home, not without memories, your family, and something or someone that you trust. Lastly, he tells us about how greatful he is that his parents brought him to a neighborhood that he would soon learn to love. This piece makes me think about and appreciate my family, and my home."
