"The builders of the Empire State building faced many challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring at the top of the building. The main challenge was caused by nature itself. The winds above the building were constantly blowing and shifting direction. This would cause any dirigible attempting to dock swing around and below in the wind, which poses many safty risks for passengers going on and off the zepplen. The dirigible could also puncture its frame on nearby buildings while attempting to dock, which also causes safty risks for people on the building and on the ground. Have a zepplen attatched to the building also made it structurally unstable and modifications had to be made the frame of the building to give it more support. In the end, the idea was dropped because it would never work and was unrealistic."
