"In The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith wanted to add a ""top"" or a ""hat"" to the Empire State Building that would function as a docking station for dirigibles. The dream was not ment to be.The first of many problems was getting the mooring mast, docking station, on top of the building. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" A dirigible would only be held by one cable.The dirigible's load and the wind presure would have to be transmitted all the way down the building. There were also safety problems. A lot of dirigibles used hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flammable. It is also very windy around the Empire State Building. The dirigibles would have to hang sandbags by ropes. These would hang above the people below. The mooring mast was a good idea, but the builders faced to many problems. The project was never completed."
