"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles when trying to make it safe for dirigibles to dock there. Three main issues they faced were adding stress to the building, safety, and urban laws. The Empire state building was already huge & fragile so adding a lot of way to it, would not have helped, ""a @DATE1 foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame."" The architects could not want this, they had to make changes. Before they made the changes, they also realized that it was extremely windy up there, ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" @CAPS1, it would be safe to be up there, never knowing how bad the winds would be. So they decided to make the building shorter. After all the work they put in, it still wasn't good enough because there was a law that was ""against airships flying to low over urban areas"". After all the time and hard work they put in, there was, in the end, no way to have this idea be successful."
