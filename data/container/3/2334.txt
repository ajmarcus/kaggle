"Docking a dirigible on top of the Empire State Building is a feat that will most likely never be accomplished. The main overall concern with allowing this is safety. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 the author discusses the infamous destruction of the Hindenburg, and the architects realized the accident would have been even more catastrophic, had it taken place over a city like New York. Nature also played a role in this struggle over making this mast work. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). The author then discusses how the dirigible would swing around the mast. And trying to weigh it down ""was neither practical nor safe"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). The final and most obvious reason this mast could not work, was that a law was passed; a law that prohibited dirigibles from flying too low to an urban area. This meant that a dirigible could not legally approach the mast. These architects had very little working for them and almost everything working against them."
