"In the short story of ""The Mooring Mast."" by Marcia Amidon Lsted describes three obstacles of the builders of the Empire State Building faced for the attemption to allow dirigibles to dock there. Two resons were safty. The first ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". A flammable ship above a ""densely populated area such as dowtown New York could result in desistiar. The second safty reson was due to ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifing due to Violent air currents."" Dirigibles ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither Practical nor safe."" The final obstacl the Empire State Building faced was Law. ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" ""This Law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the buildings or even approach the area."" The Law and to safty obstacles the builders of the Empire' State Building faced would not allow any attempts for dirigibles to dock there."
