"There were a few features in the setting that affected the cyclist. One very important feature is that the cyclist was in the desert. This is demonstrated by the statement ÒI was travelling through the high deserts of California.Ó not only was the cyclist in the desert, he was there in June, one of the hottest months of the year. It is demonstrated that he was there in June reading to the statement ÒI was travelling in June.Ó @CAPS1 there at that time made dehydration a bigger risk. It was also very hot there. We know this because when he was at the water pump, he stated, Òblackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.Ó From this, we can affirm that not only was at hot, the water was dirty. The water also Òhad the flavor of battery acid.Ó This was bad for the cyclist who was running low on water because he Òhad been hitting (his) water bottles pretty regularly.Ó The fact that he had little water left is demonstrated in the statement, ÒThe water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.Ó The cyclist was in a bad situation. These had ganged-up against him in his trip. These features are the desert, the high temperatures, and the blackish water which tasted like battery acid. The fact that he was low on water made it harder to fight these features with water, he would battle the desert, high temperatures, and have no need to pump bad water. Again, the features of the setting that affected the cyclist are the desert, the high temperatures, and the bad water which he could not drink."
