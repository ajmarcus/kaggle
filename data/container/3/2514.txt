"Right now I going to tell us Some of the obtacles the builders of the Empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, In paragraph @NUM1, the architects were blind to the potential problems of the mast because Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Second, in paragraph @NUM2 the greatest obstacle to this successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Third, in paragraph @NUM3, the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This is why never was completed the mooring mast (dirigible) for this serious obstacles to put this in the Empire state building."
