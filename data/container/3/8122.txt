"The mood that was crea ted by the author was love, and inspiration The mood was love because throughout the whole story he told his parents that he loved them and was proud of them. he feels proud of them because of all they do for him and the family. So he is proud of them. he is also greatful to have parents like this because they do so much for him they cook, clean, and keep a roof over his head and keep him protected. The other mood that is created for me is inspiration this mood is created because of what he says ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perservirence. this means that he is proud of his parents and he is thankful for what they do for him, he says tha he is thankful for all they have sacrificed. These are some examples of the mood that was created."
