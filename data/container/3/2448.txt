"The builders of the Empire state building faced alot of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the lack of suitable landing areas. They usually land in open fields, where they are weighed down with lead weights. In New York they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street. Another obstacle was safety. Most dirigibles use hydrogen, which is highly flammable. They worried an accident like the Hindenburg could happen, only this time it would be above a densely populated area. Another obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas, so it would be illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building. The Final obstacle was Forceful winds. They could blow the dirigible onto the Sharp spires of other buildings and puncture the Shell, the captain couldn't take his hands off the control levers. All in all the mooring mast was not a very well thoughtout idea and it would not have been safe at all."
