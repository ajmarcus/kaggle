"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there, ""The architect could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"". A thousand-foot diriglble tethed by a single caple would add to much stress to the building's frame. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. If not the Empire State Building might fall over. For the Empire State Building to take the extra load the architect would have to modify and strengthen the building's existing framework. Also the ornate mast would be difficult to raise on top of the Empire State build due to the high winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". If the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the dirigible would swivel around and around the mooring mast. If this happened the dirigible would crash into the Empire State Building or other building. This would be bad for the people on the street. Where dirigible's usually land are in open fields. The dirigible could be weighted down in the back with a lead weight. But on top of the Empire State Building dangling weights above pedestrians was neither practical nor safe. Also laws were passed restricting a dirigible from getting to close to a building."
