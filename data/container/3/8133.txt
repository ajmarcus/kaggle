"The mood that the author created throughout the course of the memoir was a sense of happiness but also family. This family moved from Cuba to @LOCATION1 with no clue what to expect, no prior knowledge of the culture or anything else. All they had was eachother which gives off a great sense of family. Then there is the happiness factor, throughout the story no matter what the sircumstances they seem to be happy because they had family. In the story it says that ""my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This lets me know that he does view his house as a home and that means he is happy."
