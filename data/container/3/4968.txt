"The settings affect the cyclist in many ways on the way to Yosemite. Well for one when he took the shortcut, one thing that already made it difficult was that it was June, and he’s out in the desert. Also it says how he went to a couple towns that were deserted so there was no way to replenish his water. It says, “I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldn’t cool down. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.” @CAPS1 thing about his setting that changed was the hills.  But once he came to a bait shop, the old man asks  him if he  knows the best way to get to Yosemite, and he responds, “yes- sir: I own a very good map.” @CAPS2 by this he’s understood that the best way to travel anywhere is the path or road he knows because he’ll know what to expect. This is how the setting changed."
