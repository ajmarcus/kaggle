"The mood of the memoir is kind and loving. It showed kindness in paragraph @NUM1, what the memoir described how his parents made the whole house feel sweet and nice. He did this by using words like ""innocence"", ""celebrations"", and ""warm home"" to create a the feel of kindness. Love was shown when the author told about the way his parents welcomed anyone of every race to live with them until they ""got back on their feet."" This shows love because when you are welcomed no matter what the problem is or who you are, it deminstrates love to everyone."
