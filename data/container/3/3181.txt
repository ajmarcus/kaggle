"Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were safety, nature and the law. One of the greatest obstacle was safety. Since blimps needed to be lighter than air, most are filled with helium or hydrogen. ""Most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This is a big obstacle because if the blimp is high off the ground of @CAPS1 and then catches on fire, that could end badly another obstacle was nature; due to violent air currents' which made buildings sway. This is also bad because if the blimp moves or the building sways into the building than one or the other could break. The last obstacle was the law, which was against 'airships flying too low over urban areas'. So if they did build the mast, it would be even illegal to get a dirigible close. So those are some obstacles builders faced in building the Empire State building to dock blimps."
