"The mood in the @ORGANIZATION1 is displayed as happieness and appreciation. Narciso understands how much his parents had given up for him by moving from Cuba to @LOCATION1. They also have always stood by his side and made sure there was only positive attitudes around him. He appreciates this so much he ends the @ORGANIZATION1 saying ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". by this he is saying it was a house that could shelter you, but a home is somewhere you want to be with family where you feel safe and comfortable. The happieness comes from the appreciation because you cant appreciat something and it doesn't make you make a little bit happier. his happieness is also portrayed in paragraph @NUM1 where he starts by saying ""I will always be greatfull to my parents for their love and sacrifice""."
