"The mood of this memoir is good. It's good because everybody is happy. Narciso is in a good mood and inviting everybody into is his. The excerpt says... ""My door will always be open"". Also in there house's they have music going on all the time. The excerpt also says... ""In our meighborhood despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship"". There were also very unselfish, caring of everyone, and did whatever they could for there families. In this memoir there was a overall pretty good mood of everybody because they were nice, inviting, and caring."
