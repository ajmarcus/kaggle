"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" there is a loving and happy mood created by the author. The author shows the love of his culture, home, and family. It makes the reader think of their family and their culture, and what and who they grow up with. The mood of this story made me think of my Italian grandparents and the sacrificies they made to get a better life for their family.The mood of this story also shows dedication, respect, admiration for loved ones. The author says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" I know when I read this line I realized all that my parents have done for me. The mood also makes me think of what my mom does for her job. She helps homeless teens find places to stay and she is always welcoming. Narciso's parents often let family and friends stay at their home to get them back on their feet.The mood of this story is very positive. It helps the reader make connections because all of our relatives know better how long ago made sacrifices for their family. The loving and respectful mood created by the author makes me think of my family."
