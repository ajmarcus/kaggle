"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major obstacle was constructing a mooring mast that would not threaten the buildings structure. The builders had to modify and strengthen the frame of the Empire State Building. According to the excerpt ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the framework."" Another big obstacle was safety. At the Empire State Building's hight it would have been illegal to land a dirigible. The dirigibles, at that time, were filled with hydrogen. If the dirigible ever exploded, it would threaten the hundreds. of pedestrians on the streets of New York City."
