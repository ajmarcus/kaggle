"The obstacles the builders faced in building the Empire State Building were nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" The size was a problem along with how high they were in the sky. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" @CAPS1 were the obstacles."
