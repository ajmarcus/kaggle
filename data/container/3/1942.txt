"Many obstacles stood in the way of docking the dirigibles on the empire state. One obstacle the builders faced was the law stating airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas. Also, the builders would have to reinforce parts of the building to support the stress the dirigibles would place on the frame.Lastly, nature would not allow the dirigibles to be safely docked due to the fact the violent winds would shift the back of the dirigible making it sway wildly. These obstacles made sure that dirigibles could not be docked at the empire state."
