"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was getting the mooring mast on top of the building. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. A thousand foot dirigible mounted at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" The architects solve this problem by modifying the building's framework. Another problem was wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" @CAPS1 there was one wire connected to the front, the dirigible would go round and round due to the back being exposed to the winds. This problem was never fixed. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles and while some were overcome, the rest weren't, resulting in the ultimate failure of the mooring mast."
