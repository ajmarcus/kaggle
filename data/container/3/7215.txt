"In this excerpt, Narciso Rodriguez describes his childhood home and extended ""family."" The mood of this duration is very warm and happy. Narciso speaks of his childhood home with only love and affection. @CAPS1's eternally grateful to his parents for turning ""... this simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 speakes admirably of his parents and the sacrifices and hard work they went through to even get to @LOCATION1, and @CAPS1 is so thankful they did. @CAPS1 also speakes lovingly of his ""extended family"" and describes his neighborhood. ""In our neighborhood..., all these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This loving, supporting ""family"" made Narciso who is is today and made him appreciate the fact that ""' family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" But instead is composed of those whom you love and who love you."
