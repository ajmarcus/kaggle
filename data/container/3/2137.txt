"Many obstacles were faced by the builders of the Empire State Building as stated in the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2. These obstacles included safety and availability. The idea of being able to dock a dirigible to a building in the middle of a densely populated city such as New York was extremely unsafe between the explosive tendencies of Hydrogen and the unmanageable winds. With the winds the dirigible would continuesly move around the mast creating an extremely unsafe environment for all. Availability would also be put into question, in paragraph fifteen @ORGANIZATION2 tells about the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles @CAPS1 to dock due to the unavailable route of save entirence. This unavailability made traveling to the mooring mast almost impossible. The obstacles in the mooring mast include availability and safety."
