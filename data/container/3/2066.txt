"In constructing the Empire State Building, builders faced multiple obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock atop the @CAPS1. One obstacle that constructors faced was modifications, ""The stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation."" With this obstacale contractors would need to reinforce the @CAPS1 of the frame and the foundation. And the obstacle as stated from the excerpt is ""most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, which is flammable."" @CAPS2 that hydrogen is flammable it would not be good if a dirigible exploded over the streets of New York. Those are the obstacles contractors faced during the construction of the Empire State Building."
