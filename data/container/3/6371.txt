"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because to her the plant seems to remind her of her homeland which calms her and when it is budding she feels stronger. In the story Saeng is kind of an outsider and when she sees the plant she sees a part of her past back home. In the story it says she gets shaky when she tries to say at home. When she says and this hibiscus is budding, I think it is really saying when she is ready to accept this country as her home because the flower is a reminder of her homeland. At the end of the story it says how see is getting used to the geese flying in a V so she is getting more used to this country and when she is ready she will take her test again."
