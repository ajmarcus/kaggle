The obstacles faced by the Empire State building builders were. one was the existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. Stated in @CAPS1 @NUM1. Another obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. With the dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a cable tether would have put stress on the building therefore they would have had to make the structure of the building stronger
