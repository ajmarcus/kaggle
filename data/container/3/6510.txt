"The author includes this last paragraph in the story, “Winter Hibiscus” to show that the main character still has hopes and has not given up on her new lifestyle. During the story, the main character Saeng reminisces on her not so distant past memories of her native home in Vietnam when she recognizes a certain plant from her country. This is important in the story because Saeng is still unhappy about moving to @LOCATION2 and she begins to cry as she walks home, having bought the plant, to her mother. “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her.” Saeng’s mother understood how she was feeling, and she was not dissapointed in her for failing her driving test either. Her mother made Saeng feel better by planting the familiar Hibiscus into the garden right away. The last paragraph of the story gives hope to the reader that Saeng will not give up her strength to live a different life in @LOCATION2 that she is not used to. “When the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” It is as if Saeng is vowing that in time, she will be happy with her new life, not just passing a driving test. The Winter Hibiscus stands as a symbol for Saeng to be strong in the new country while still remembering her old life in Vietnam.    "
