"The geese flying south for the winter and the hibiscus budding are normal things to Saeng. The author wanted to conclude the story with this to show that Saeng felt comfort in things that she was acustomed to. Saeng wanted to have the geese and hibiscus there to feel more comfortable while taking her driving test. Saeng still longs for home and does not quite feel like she fits in the u.s. The hibiscus gives her that comfort feeling like she is home again, in Vietnam, Saeng still feels homesick because she wants things to be how they were. The plants in the green house along with the disappointment of failing her driving test bring her to the emotional state that she was in. In the second to last paragraph the author talks about the feeling of repetition Saeng has when seeing the v formation. Saeng feels that in the winter she will not have the same comfort feeling as when she can see the hibiscus and the geese flying overhead. It says when Saeng arrived in the @LOCATION2 she had nothing that was familiar to her.  Now she gets that feeling from the geese and plants. The author concluding by saying Saeng will take her driving test when the winter ends is a good closing because it gives you some insight as to what Saeng is going to do."
