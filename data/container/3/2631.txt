"Based on the excerpt, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle is described in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would and stress to the building's frame."" This means that they would need to strength the whole building. If they didn't the building would maybe fall over. The next obstacle is described in paragraph @NUM2, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" This means that the wind is so strong up there, it would take a while to land safely. Also, that the wind could cause the dirigible to fly away. The @CAPS1 obstacle is described in paragraph @NUM3, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. ""This means they could be a target to destroy the building. Another thing, is that if it ever fell it would kill a lot of people. These obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were not overcome and the project was cancelled."
