"The mood created in this memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives is a magnificent mood. A family move to the United States from Cuba so there @CAPS1 could have a better education. They have a nice home nice friends and a good and caring family. The neighbor, landlord, or friend Alegria makes them dinner some times. Also, they have friends that go over for dinner and often bring some food over with them. They have a family/friends that were Spanish, Cuban, and Italian people. They always had there door open for friend and family and most of there friend would go over every night. They would let people stay at there house if they needed help or if they had to rest. The mood was magnificent in this story."
