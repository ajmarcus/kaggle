"In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, he describes his experience of bike riding in the desert. The setting affects the cyclist in many ways throughout the writing. At first, Kurmaskie is confident as he listens to a group of old codgers giving him advice. The setting is calm and happy and Kurmaskie writes that he “enjoyed the serenity of an eary-summer evening”. The word “serenity” gives the affect of calm and peace. However, as Kurmaskie proceeds into his journey, the setting changes. He is troubled by the “ramshackle shed, several rutsy pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule” in a ghost town that he meets in the desert. Even later, the terrain changes and he sees a sign stating “Rough Road Ahead”. Kurmaskie’s confidence turns into even deeper doubt and worry as his water supply runs low. Finally, kurmaskie sees a sign for a fish camp. Here, his hope returns as he finds a “rather modern bathroom” where he can stop to get a drink. As the setting changes, Kurmaskie’s confidence is followed by determination and then relief."
