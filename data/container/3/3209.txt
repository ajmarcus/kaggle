"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first, it says the building's foundation will be more stress with a thousand-foot dirigible docking. For example ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" The second, it says that it's really dangerous if they take place above the building. For example, ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. ""@CAPS1, it says the winds on the top of the building are so strong. For example ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" In conclusion, they still face to many obstacles, so the idea which let the dirigibles dock on the top of the building is hardly become true. "
