"The Empire State Building was built as the tallest building in the World and even today still remains one of the tallest. It had design plans with more of a purpose then just being the tallest building, however. It was supposed to serve as a passenger exchange and a refueling dock for dirigibles. Most people do not know this though because there were many complications involved with the architectural designs of this plan for the mast. Architects knew it would not be easy to build such a creation and that they ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building."" They knew, for example that the building needed to be modified to accommodate for the added stress from the mast and the height of the building would need to be increased. They made the necessary changes to the building but the realities of the progect soon set in, and the mast was never built, ""the greatest reason being for safety."" The hydrogen used to power the dirigibles was highly flamable and endangered the citizens of New York  Also, according to the aricle, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" There are powerful winds at that high of an altitude that would blow and make it difficult as for the dirigibles to be properly controlled and navigated."
