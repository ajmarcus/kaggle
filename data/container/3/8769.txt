"In the memoirs of Narciso Rodriguez, the mood of the writing is grateful. The two main examples of what Narciso is grateful for are his heritage and his family. Narciso is very grateful for his heritage and is a proud cuban. I know this because in paragraph @NUM1 he talks about how he loves cuban food, cooking, and music and how he is grateful for all of them. Another thing that Narciso is extremely grateful for is his family. His family moved up to @LOCATION1 before he was born so that their children could have a better life. They have sacrificed so much for their children including social and financial sacrifices. In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso writes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Any sane human being would be grateful to have parents that did what Narciso's parents did for him. As now evident, the main focus and mood of this excerpt from @PERSON1 memoirs is that he is grateful."
