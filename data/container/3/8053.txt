"The mood in this memoir is very moving and heart-felt. By the way the author writes about his family @CAPS1 can just feel the warmth and love that his family provided for him ""... my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today."" @CAPS1 can just tell by this quote how much of an impact Narciso Rodriguez's parents had on his life. It also explains how crafted his parents were and how intelligent they were. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @PERSON2 most deffinatly loved his family. "
