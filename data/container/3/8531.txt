"Narciso Rodriguez creates many moods in his memoir. In him memoir Narciso states ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" From this statement I feel the mood is loving and kindness.     He also states ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This changes the mood to greatfulness and selflessness of the parents. The last statement I thought really changed the mood was ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The mood when the author says that is I think thankfulness. Those are so examples of how @PERSON1 changed the mood thought out him memoir."
