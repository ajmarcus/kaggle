"The author concludes the story with this line to show that just like the hibiscus, adapting and strgging to survive and fit in in it’s non-natve land, Saeng will too. She will not give up her fight to pass the test to become a part of her new country. This is supported through out the story when her mother connents on the hibiscus by the late. She says, “It’s strong enough to make it through the cold month here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matter” (Ho @NUM1). Here the author shows the comparison between the hibiscus' struggle through hard times in a foreign land similarly felt in Saeng’s life. Both must be strong fight through hard imes where no, one, “not even her class mates or frends, or Mrs. Lambert” (Ho @NUM1), understood how alone out of place she felt. So just as she vows to take the test again, shes promising herself she will fight through the hard times grow strong, just as her winter hibiscus."
