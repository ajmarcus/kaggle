And How all culture just came together as great solidarity and friendship doubt to when overt racism was norm and segregation prevailed in United @ORGANIZATION1. He learned the true meaning of family. How his parent turn a regluar house into home that he loved. He was grateful how his parent made so many sacrifice that turn something into life time expenence that he will never forget. He was happy how little thing turn it great memories, that he can't wait to tell the world."
