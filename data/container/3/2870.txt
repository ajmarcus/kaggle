"While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. The first obstacle they dealt with was the fact that mooring such heavy blimps would add stress to the building. In fact, 'the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation.' Another obstacle they endured was the fact that the hydrogen gas used in the dirigible was very flammable. As bad as the Hindenburg explosion was, it could have been much worse, 'if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York.' It was also very dangerous that the blimps would fly so low over an urban area. Lastly, the strong winds would making mooring difficult. Winds that high up on a building are, 'constantly shifting due to violent air currents.' The workers clearly had many problems in building the mast and it just couldn't be completed."
