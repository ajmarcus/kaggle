"The cyclist see his journey affect by a succesion of events that will make his journey trave?? every time more difficul and difficult. One of the first errors his makes is take advice from people that have no clue of where there are at. @CAPS1 (I shouldn't have done was let them have a peek at my map.) The temperature of the desert also influenced him (I was travelling through high desert of California). The  cyclist also finds his' self with a combination of emotions at times he thinks he is going to past away and at times he believes he will be fine.
