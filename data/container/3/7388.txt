Even though""(thier) nieghorhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States"" (@NUM2) they all cared for each other as if they were one family. Prior to moving to the United States, ""Narciso, Sr., had worked in the laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studed chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start thier lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find"" (@NUM3). They moved to the United States, leaving their good jobs, so that thier son could live a better life Narciso doesnt take this for granted. He engulfs the in a profusion of thanks.
