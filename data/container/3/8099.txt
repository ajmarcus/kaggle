"one mood of this memoir was that of a traditional Cuban home. In the memoir, paragraph @NUM1, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary Skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban Music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" A second mood of this memoir was the impression of a Cuban family who faced my hardships. In the memoir, paragraph @NUM2 ""They Struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" The last mood gives me the impression of what a real family is about: love, loyalty and friendship. In the memoir, paragraph @NUM3 ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."
