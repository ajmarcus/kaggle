"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez the author sets a mood. The mood that is set is happy, greatful, and loving. In paragraph @NUM1 it states ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" The author is very happy his parents did this for him. In paragraph @NUM2 it states ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"". And in paragraph @NUM3 it states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The author loves his home for all the memories and friendships it holds, and is greatful to his parents who provided him with it."
