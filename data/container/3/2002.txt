"In ""The Mooring Mask"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building faced were nature, safety and the law. Al Smith, @CAPS1 of New York and headed construction of the Empire State Building, was determined to make it the tallest building ever. This would be impossible without a mooring mast, which would serve as a docking station for Dirigibles.In building the mooring mast, came obstacles. One obstacle was nature. There were violent wind speeds at the top of the building, which would cause the dirigible to sway back and forth. Lead weights were typically used to keep from swaying, but if used here, lead weights would be dangling @NUM1 ft above pedestrians heads. Which leads to safety being another obstacle. Many dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a gas that is highly flammable, if ignited, the possibly largest accident would occur to New York City. The Final obstacle is the law. There is a law that states ""airships may not fly too low over urban areas."" Which would make the mooring mast's purpose illegal. Today, it is nothing more but decoration."
