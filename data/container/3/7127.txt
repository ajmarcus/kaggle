"The mood in the memoir ""Narciso @CAPS1"" is a Open happy familly because her parents worked and made a wonderful home for her. I think the mood in the story is a open happy family becase in the text it says ""Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood related"" and that @CAPS3 that when @CAPS2 was growing up her family had a bunch of people that were considered family but not blood related. Also the text said ""It was a close knit community of honest, hardworking imigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" That just @CAPS3 that her parants let anyone from their community who needed a family become part of their familly, or anybody who was lonley just have some company from them."
