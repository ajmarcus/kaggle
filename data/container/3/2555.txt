"Based on the excerpt there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle the builders faced was the dirigibles were too big and could be dangerous. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" This shows that it will be harder to build the mast than expected. Another obstacle the builders ran into was that the building would have to be modified. ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" The biggest obstacle the builders faced is that it wasn't safe. ""Most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" @CAPS1 some of the obstacles the builders ran into"
