"The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is that when he arrived in the United States he was given the opportunty that so many immigrants wanted and that was education. His parents still carried that cuban culture they had that was especially in their kitchen because both his parent loved making food, and they had great culunary skills which he learned. They would have cuban music going while they were setting the table. The @CAPS1 tells us that when his parent were still in Cuba his dad worked in a laboratory and his mother had studied chemical enginerring. The @CAPS1 says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."""
