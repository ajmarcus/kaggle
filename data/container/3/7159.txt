"I think that the mood created by the author was happiness. I think this because when @CAPS1 was talking throughout the story @CAPS1 talked about how great her life was and how nice your parents are. @CAPS1 talked about her life as being very nice because @CAPS1 grew up in a house that turned into a home. Also, @CAPS1 talked about the great cooking that went on in her house and all of the great music, that @CAPS1 still loves today. Also, @CAPS1 talks about how caring her parents were when they opened there doors to family that needed a place to stay until they got back on their feet. Lastly, I think the mood set by the author was happiness because @CAPS1 had a lot of her family or close friends living either above or below them. Those are the reasons I thought the mood set by the author was happiness."
