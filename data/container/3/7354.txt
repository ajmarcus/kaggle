"In this memoir, the author creates a very calming and relaxing mood. The author talked about how family isn't about blood, and how a house doesn't have to be spectacular to be a home. The authors said in the memoir ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This basically means that with all the love and care his parents had toward him and his neighbors, created a great place to live. The mood also very hopefull. This is because the author's parents came to america with nothing, but with all their hard work, they over came their struggles and helped everyone else in their neighborhood. Another mood the story had was a loving mood, because even though his neighbors weren't his blood relatives, he loved them as if they were."
