"The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with a sentence about retaking the drivers test in the spring, to express the themes of adopting to circumstances and determination to succeed. The main character in the story, Saeng, is a @CAPS1 immigrant. Because @CAPS2 is not her homeland, there are still many aspects of life here she is not accustomed to, and the story shows her struggle to adapt. For instance when she sees the flower “Madagascar penwinhle” she thinks “how strange to see it in a pot” because “Back home it just grows wild,” The last sentence of the story is symbolic when it says “and the geese return,” because the geese adapt to circumstances by flying south for the winter, just like Saeng is trying to do, and Saeng realizes their pattern are becoming familiar. The very last line says “I will take that test again.” This summarizes the determination Saeng has throughout the entire story. Not only is she determined to succeed in her driver’s test, but in other things as well. For example, when trying to plant the hibiscus Saeng observes that “the soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting her shovel into it. Despite the difficulty, though, she “Dug out a hole” and knows it’s strong enough to move it through the cold months just like Saeng will be strong enough to overcome obstacles if she tries. The last sentence in the story is significant. It expresses important themes and lends valuable insight into Saeng’s character.  "
