"When allowing dirigibles to dock of the empire state building they were faced with many obstacles. One of the many obstacles the builders were faced with was the empire state building was not well structured to hold a dirigible of @NUM1 ft and the buildings structure would need to be modified to altleast sisty thousand dollars more. Another obstacle the builders had faced was the dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium so hydrogen was very flamable This ment they didnt want something bad to take place above the building and in a ""populated area like downtown new york"". The last main obstacle they had to face was the mooring mast was always differer by the nature around it and the dirigibles would wear on its causing danger to people in the town of new york. Those were the few obstacles the builders had on allowing drigibles to dock near the empire state building"
