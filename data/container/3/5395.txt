"The short story, Winter Hibiscus, is a about a girl who moved with her mother to @LOCATION1. The story tells about the girls transition into the different culture. During the story, the author makes references to the daughter having to pass a test. At the end of the story the author wrote “In the spring…then I will take that test again.” In the text, the girl says “it’s-it’s not a real one,” when referring to the winter hibiscus plant she bought. The reader could infer that this quote means that the girl has memories of home, but they are not the real thing. Also the author wrote “… much preferred it to the Big Mac"". This quote shows that she misses her own culture & cannot adapt to the @CAPS1 one that she lives in now. In conclusion, the girls test @MONTH1 be that she needs to be able to handle change & also be able to recall memories of her homeland with happiness instead of sadness."
