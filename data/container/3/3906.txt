"In the beginning of the cyclists journey, he is very happy and carefree. The cyclist comes to the first deserted town the setting isnt described because the cyclist is not worried yet. After leaving the first town the cyclist barely noticed the heat because, the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. The cyclist still has high spirits. The cyclist begins to get thirsty when he comes upon a water pump. He attempts to get water but the pump isnt in working condition. Until this point in the story to road has been mostly flat and straight. Then the cyclist notices that the road has some hills in it. At this point the cyclist has no water and is very dehydrated. After one hill the cyclist sees a building. The building is an abandoned grape juice factory, which is ironic considering the state the cyclist is in. The cyclist sucks on rocks as a last resort and gives up hope of living , when he comes upon a fish camp. He gets water from the bathroom and all is well. The setting in this story affects the cyclist because as the setting changes, so do the cyclist moods and feelings about survival and the danger he is in."
