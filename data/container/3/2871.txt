"From the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", There were multiple obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced. In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles the builders faced was the agianst airships flying too low over urban areas. The law would make it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building or ever approach the area. Another obstacle the builders faced was forceful winds. ""The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached The mooring mast but could not get close enough To tie up because of forceful winds."" The greatest obstacle was the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. The last obstacle was the dirigible wasn't safe to have dangling high about pedestrians."
