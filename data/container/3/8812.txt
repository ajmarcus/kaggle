"The tone of Narciso Rodriguez's memoir was a happy one with many positive feelings, memories, and undertones mixed in. Rodriguez sets the mood in the @NUM1 paragraph when @CAPS2 describes the warm, inviting, and cozy feeling that was given off at his home. Here @CAPS2 describes how ""passionate Cuban music... filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This gives off a warm, innocent vibe, staging the mood for the memoir @CAPS1, in paragraph @NUM2, the mood is expanded so that it also encopasses the welcoming feel of the house. Here, Rodriguez says that his ""parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people [they] considered family"". Finally, this excerpt gives off a proud and graceful mood. This pride and gratitude from Narciso Rodriguez is directed toward his parents @CAPS2 uses many words like ""courage"", ""selflessly"", ""struggled"", ""braving"", and ""hardships"" to describe Rawedia and @PERSON2's actions with a proud undertone Rodriguez then talks about how grateful @CAPS2 is to his parents ""for their love and sacrifice"" (paragraph @NUM3). Then @CAPS2 goes on to talk about how deeply grateful @CAPS2 is towards his parents for all they did for him in great detail. The mood of this memoir is happy, welcoming, warm, grateful, and proud. that would make anyone yearn for the one place where they too felt this feeling circulating around them"
