"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness and greatfulness Here are my three reasons why I think that First of all, Narciso is proud of the way @CAPS2 lives and who @CAPS2 is. It all began, starting with his parents, they are immagrants. ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house.""@CAPS1 of all, @CAPS2 cherished every moment @CAPS2 lived. @CAPS2 is grateful for all the things his parents did for him and everyone else. ""my parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we consider family"".Finally, His parents migrated from cuba. They are known as immagrents because they was not born in america, and narciso is proud and honestly happy for them. Thats why I think the mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness and greatfulness."
