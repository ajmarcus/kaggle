"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One issue was the violent air currents that were at the top of the building. Even if the dirigibles successfully docked at the top of the building the back end of it would be thrashing around from the wind. If this happened and the blimp became uncontrollable it could crash into another building and fall to the ground where all the downtown New @CAPS1 walk. Putting weights on the end of the blimp would help that situation but as @CAPS2 says, ""dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" Another issue the builders faced was the fact that dirigibles were highly flammable. They learned their lesson and got it into their heads that their idea might not be so good after when the German blimp, the Hindenburg, was destroyed. "
