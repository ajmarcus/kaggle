"After reading The mooring mast, by Marcia Amidon Lsted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building are faced with in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are evident. The number one reason is because it is not safe. First, most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flamable. The chance of a fire starting is especially not good because its a highly populated area. Also, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (@NUM1). With the building being so high,"" winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@NUM1). The conclusion has been made the dirigibles land in landing fields because they can be weighted down in the back with lead weights. This method would not be safe if used on the Empire State Building. Clearly, the builders of the Empire State Building are faced with too many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there."
