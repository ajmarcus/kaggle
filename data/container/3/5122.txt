"The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. For one, he was biking through the high deserts of California in June. This caused the cyclist to become overheated ad sweaty. So he drank from his water bottles frequently. Unfortunately, since there was, no one insight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind, he had nowhere to fill his bottles and become dehydrated. To make matters worse, the terrain changed from flat road to short, rolling hills. Normally, this would not cause too much struggle, but since he was dehydrated and overheated, each hill seemed crippling, My thoughts are that if the setting had been a bit cooler and perhaps on the time period the old men had lived in, the cyclist would have had a much more enjoyable experience."
