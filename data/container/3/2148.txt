"Based on the excerpt the builders faced many obstacles trying to attempt dirigibes to be allowed to dock on the Empire State building. The builders faced obstacles like the lack of land area in New York as said in @CAPS1 6. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 it says that a big problem they faced was they could just land right on the flat roof and some other problems they faced in this @CAPS1 was the cable at the top of the building added stress to the building eleven hundred feet below the building and some of this work cost over sixty Thousand dollars. Problems with safety is the lead wieght be dangling high above pedestrians on the street which was niether practical or safe. And another unsafe thing is in @CAPS1 @NUM2, they said that Hydrogen in these dirigibles was highly flammable which is very unsafe. In ¦ @NUM3 it says that there was an existing law against flying airship above urban areas."
