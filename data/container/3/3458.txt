"The men who were constructing the building did not put enough thought in to the practicality of the new form. One major issue with the dirigibles landing there to fuel up is the fact that they could explode. There had been blimp accident before and it wasn't in a heavily populated area like New York is. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1).The winds at the top of the building would also blow the back end of the blimp around, and it isn't safe to have lead weights hanging over pedestrians, and the Blimp would be to low. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" ( @NUM2) ""-the back of the ship would swivel around and around-"" ( @NUM2) ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" ( @NUM2) the architects should've thought their plan through better."
