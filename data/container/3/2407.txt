"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, the author describes many challenges the architects faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects had new challenges that would almost seem impossible to prevent at times. The height of the building, the weight of the dirigible against the building, and the fact that dirigibles are highly flammable, adds to the many obstacles the architects were faced with. The height of the building was a major problem for the architects. It was very difficult for pilots to safely maneuver around buildings, especially in a city with many buildings. The unpredictable winds meant the dirigibles could be blown into a building at any point. There was even a law against it that ""would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (para @NUM1). Another problem the architects encountered was the high flammability of the dirigibles. The dirigibles made in most other countries were made with hydrogen rather than helium. After another dirigible caught on fire people realized how much worse ""that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (para @NUM2). The biggest problem of all was the weight of the dirigibles on the massive height of the building. The architects saw that, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings' foundation"" (para @NUM3). They knew this was very unsafe for the passangers unloading and for the people in the building. Overall, the problems and challenges the architects faced were too strong for them to overcome."
