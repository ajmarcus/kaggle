"The architects of the mooring mast faced many problems when building the mast itself. One of the problems was that most dirigibles outside of the country use hydrogen, which was highly flammable, rather than helium to make the blimps buoyant. If one of those blimps ever caught fire like the German dirigible, the Hindenburg, in New Jersey, then it would put many citizens in jeopardy. This densely populated area would be much more hazardous than a rural area in New Jersey.The last problem they faced was the law that prohibited airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made ""it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" @CAPS1 no foreign dirigible could dock and refuel there because of the type of gas keeping it afloat, while no @CAPS2 dirigible could dock and refuel because of the law prohibiting it, the idea of a mooring mast quickly diminished from the citizens imaginations and they looked to modern transportation such as airplanes."
