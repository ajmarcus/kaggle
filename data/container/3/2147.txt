"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the was obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow derigibles to dock there. One obsacle was that dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. This was a problem because as it says in paragraph @NUM1, line four, ""hydrogen is highly flammable."" The geatest obstacle for builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigible to dock was nature itself. Nature itself would be an obstacle because ""dirigibles moored in open fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weighths, but using the at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" This were some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow derigibles to dock there."
