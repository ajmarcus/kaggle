"The mood in this memoir seems to be a grateful tone. The reason I say that is because Narciso says how grateful he was to have parents that left everything behind so that he could have a better life. He also sounded grateful when he talked about the Spanish, Cuban, and Italian people in his neighborhood would work together instead of being racist to each other. He also mentioned that he learned the meaning of ""family"" while living in that house. By ""family"" he didn't mean blood relative Family. What he means by family is everyone that would come into his apartment and everyone in the building was family too. The mood he has while writing the memoir is grateful."
