"At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path.. being out in the desert with limited or no water can make one feel like life is very cruel. The sun was beating down and no water or shade is seen when he reaches a point. The sign that said Rough @CAPS1 ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit. had to be intimidating.
