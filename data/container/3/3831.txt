"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him in a near death situation. He said sometimes life can be so cruel. because he was running out of water, running out of strength, and running out of patience. Also a snake ""it really did look like a diamond back, could have killed him. He was in the desert and anything could happen. The setting of old men who didnt know anything and the heat could have killed the cyclist. The situation would have been different if it were anywhere else."
