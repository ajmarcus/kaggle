"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before construction ever took place. The main reason for this was safety. First, there was a chance that it could catch on fire. For example, most dirigibles are made of hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. They relized how much damage it could do if it caught on fire in a densely populated area, such as downtown New York. Secondly, they had another obstacle to the successful use of the mooring that was nature itself. For example, the wind on top of the building was constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. Lastly dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building because they was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach it. Instead of becoming the transportation of the future the idea had disappeared. They faced to many obstacles that could not be overcome."
