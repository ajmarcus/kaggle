"In Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects the cyclist. The cyclist takes advice from some old guys and ends up wishing he never did. He is on an empty road, flat and dry. He ends up drinking all of the water he has, and needing to stop for some more. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. He stopped to get more water, but once, all that came out was some tar like stuff, and then he couldnt find another place for quite a white. The flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills and he came to a sigh that said Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit, and passed tumble weeds and a large snake. All of these things impacted his journey with fear, caution, etc. When he finally reached a place to get a drink, he was finally satisfied. Because it was hot, and empty, he was more thirsty so therefore the setting affected the cyclist."
