"In this excerpt the Architect/Workers had to face several obstacles while trying to construct a docking area on the Empire State Building for dirigibles. They had to find away for this huge mast not to kill the building frame The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand foot dirigible moored the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" They had to find away to make the load less bearing on the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" To fix this Architects and Workers must modifie the steel frame because of the new situation. After this was built and done they had to face the facts that this was imposible to do or not allowed. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The Architects and worker went through so many obsticales to then find out its dangerous and the law not to fly so close to urban area's."
