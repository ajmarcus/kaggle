"There were many problems to over come in the construction of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. The first problem to over come was the stress a thousand foot long dirigible would add to the buildings frame. This was solved by spending over @MONEY1 in modifying the building's frame work. Another problem was a law against airships flying too low around urban environments, brought up in paragraph @NUM1. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" @CAPS1 is writing about the wind. At 1,250 feet high the wind is violent, and would swing a dirigible around to much to be safe, and ends could not be weighed down for fear of injuring a pedestrian. Those were three signifigant reasons the mooring mast failed."
