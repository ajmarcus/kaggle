"Narciso Rodriguez creates a mood -- feeling, rather -- of belonging, ""home"", and comfort. He recalls growing up in an apartment where ""countless extended family members came and went"" and his life was full of people from his community -- cousins, aunts, friends. Narciso recalls that his parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family"" -- and there is a sense of belonging. Comfort: ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.""There's also a sense of thanks in this -- gratefulness, one could say. Narciso's parents left everything behind when they immigrated to @LOCATION1 from Cuba -- and as he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" And this -- all of this -- creates the sense of ""home""."
