"The mood Created by the @CAPS2 in the memoir was happy. First thing @CAPS1 the mood is happy Of this memoir is when the @CAPS2 wrote ""Passionate Cuban music (which I dore to this day)"" that meant that @CAPS3 really love her Culture music. Another thing is when @CAPS3 said ""Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative, And for that true you dont have to be related to someone who really love to say that he/@CAPS3 is @CAPS5 of your family is Just enoght that he/@CAPS3 love and care about you like you for he/@CAPS3. Last thing is when the @CAPS2 said ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home, that meant that @CAPS3 will never Forget that her family began so small And then turn big because their family went to their house and they stared their new life in the house."
