The way that the author described his home and early years provided an image of a large happy family throughout the passage. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it states ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.""  This portrays the image that life in the author's home was friendly and loving. Another example is in paragraph @NUM2 where it says ""countless extended family members came and went - and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" This means that their family was very close and would always look out for eachother. So in conclusion, the mood in this memoir is portrayed as very happy, upbeat, and loving."
