The problems That The empire state building faced was alot of things for one example it was Never @CAPS1 out clearly because They didn't know about The law That aircrafts could Not come @CAPS2 any suburb areas and They really saw what could of happened when The hindenburg burned to the ground. Anthor great obstacles They faced was Nature becuse The winds on top of the building were always shifting because of violent air currents and This would cause The dirigble To swivel around the mooring mast. one last obstacle That was faced was The structure of the dirigble becuse if it kept on landing on Top of The building it would keep on destroying The building's sturcture. These are some of The obsacles that were faced.
