"The features of the setting in the story “DO Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, affect the cyclist in the story, in many ways. The first of which would definetly be the lack of water the cyclist had, and the fact that there wasn’t anywhere around for miles. From the text it read “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This evidence from the text proves to the reader that the cyclist was getting worried. Another part of the setting would be the obvious element of temperature. The cyclist is our in the hot, relentless desert. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” The author here, by using the elements of nature, is trying to make the reader concerned/scared for the main character. The final key had to travel and the road conditions. Although the desert is flat, he began to notice some hills in the road, and such a long distance, including the heat, could be deadly. The setting’s elements, greatly effect the cyclist in this story."
