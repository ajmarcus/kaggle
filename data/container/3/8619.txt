"The mood created by the author in the memoir is greatful. For example, his parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to him their rich Culinary Skills and a love of cooking that is still with him today (and for which @CAPS2 is eternally greatful. That @CAPS1 that @CAPS2 loves to follow his parents goals and @CAPS2 loves them very much. In addition, @CAPS2 will always be greatful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. @CAPS2 has often told them how courageous they are for letting people into their home. @CAPS2 loves them for their strength and perseverance, and @CAPS2 has thanked them repeatedly. But in reality there is no way to express his gratitude for the spirit of generosity and pressed upon him as such an early age, and how @CAPS2 knows how important family and friends are."
