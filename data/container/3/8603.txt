"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the @CAPS1 create a mood in this memoir. ""Growing up in this environment instilled im me sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood related."" That mean people that weren't blood related, he still constiders them an family. He also says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That mean that evan though it wasn't a nice house it was still his home and he loved it. The mood of this memoir is love and he will never forget it. Thats the kind of mood in this memoir."
