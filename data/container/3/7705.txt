"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a good mood. It is a good mood and it also explains the hardships along the way, such as moving from cuba to the united States. It was a good mood because the parents of Narciso Rodriguez always let people who needed help in their home until they could get back on their feet, paragraph four. Their is a nice attitude towards everything through good times and bad always a good attitude. Narciso's parents let family and friends over for dinner all the time for cuban cooking and music. Every One has such a great attitudes. This selection has a soft, nice, and good mood."
