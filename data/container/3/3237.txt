"The architects, engineers, and workers or the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to attach a dirigible dock the top of the building. The first troubling encounter for the builders was they ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state building."" The engineers and architects needed to make @NUM1 dollars worth of repairs to strengthen the buildings frame work. Mother nature herself was also a problem. The constantly shifting winds would make it hard to stay landed unless they were weighed down. Even weighing down the zeppelins proposed a threat of a weight falling and killing an innocent person. lastly a law prevented dirigibles from flying to low over a city. If a spike from another building hit and popped the ballon, there would be an absolute disaster. Overall there were many obstacles preventing the idea of a dirigible dock to ever become true."
