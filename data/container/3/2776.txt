"When designing the mooring mast for the Empire State Building there were many challenges architects and builders had to over come. First were the basic problems of any transportation hub, how to move people and baggage around the terminal. Another more complicated problem was how the compensates for the added stress on the building's frame from the dirigible's load and the wind pressure. This problem was solve by @MONEY1 redesign of the Empire State Building frame. Also mored dirigibles would be constantly swing around due to the violent wind currents at the top of the Empire State Building. Weights could not be used to hold the airship in place because it would be a danger to people on the streets below. The architects could not design a way to hold it drigible in place. Eventually the idea of a mooring mast for dirigibles at the top of the Empire State Building was scrapped."
