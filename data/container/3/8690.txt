"The mood created in Rodriguez's memoir is one of gratefulness + happiness. There are supporting feelings such as coziness + friendlyness but Rodriguez himself most exhibits gratefulness. In paragraph @NUM1, there is a great catalogue of gratefulness to the social skills that were passed down to him. When in paragraph @NUM2 he talks about their cuban feast, a small one perhaps but with true love + life. You get a true sense of the gratefulness Rodriguez displays for his parents not because of who they are or how much money they have or what they give him (materialistically), but being genuinely grateful of the nature + kindness bestowed to him."
