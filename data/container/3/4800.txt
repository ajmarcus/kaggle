"There are several features of the setting that greatly affect the cyclist. One feature is the desert he is biking through. The heat of a desert in June can easily dehydrate someone. When exposed for a long time, exercising, and running out of water, the effect is even greater. In addition, the change in terrain and road surface would have an effect on the cyclist. Traveling on a flat road requires much less effort then climbing hills. If the road is also rough, the biker has to work even harder to push the up the hill. There is also the mental effort of not tipping the bike on the uneven surface. Finally, there are not any buildings in sight. When someone is dehydrated but has no water, they are desperate to find some. However, if there is nothing they know of nearby, they will start to lose hope. Once they lose hope they won’t try as hard to keep going and they will lose some of their strength. Considering all of the things negatively affecting the cyclist, it is amazing that he managed to push through and reach a source of water. "
