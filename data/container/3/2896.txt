"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" the builders found many obstacles on the way to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the empire state building Some of those obstacles were as follow. The main concern was the safety of the passenger boarding and unboarding as well as the people below The concern for the people below was how the dirigible sometimes was floating with hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable. So they didn't want chances of the dirigible blowing up. Another main concern was there was an ""exsiting law over airships flying to low over urban areas"" (par @NUM1) The dirigible floated with the air and being as long as @NUM2 ft. the back of the dirigible where it wasn't securely fastened would circle around the mooring from the high wind currents. The winds were shifting all the time so it was a very big safety issue. Another obstacle was the dirigible docking, was mainly put into place because of jealousy. The man was jealous because his competition Al Smith was catching up with him before the idea of dirigible came to mind."
