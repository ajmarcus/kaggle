"The author concluded the story with the paragraph because it shows that everything and everyone can make it through a tough time. This paragraph acts as a final positive message to readers. The text say, “when they come back... I will take that test again”. This quote shows that Saeng can see herself as one of the geese or the budding hibiscus plants. She knows that her “winter” is her test and that when she is ready, she’ll be able to take the test again and be successful. The budding of the hibiscus represents the time when she’ll be prepared to take the test. Though she is having a tough tine now, she'll be able to get through it and make another attempt. This paragraph is at the end because it brings together the purpose of the hibiscus. Without saying this, the readers would have never gotten this message, instead, they would believe that the role of the hibiscus was to serve as a connection to Saeng’s past. In conclusion, this positive paragraph was included to show readers that everyone can balance back from a bad situation."
