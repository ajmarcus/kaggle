"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there where difficult. One of the obstecles they faced was fixing the Empire State Building and the cost was high. For example in the excerpt it said ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" The plan never fully went thru because safety was an issue. Fire and people getting hurt on the streets was a big risk they could not make. It was also illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. The obstacles that the builders had to face made the idea impossible to happen."
