"In the piece ""The Mooring MAst,"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted, it describes what the mast on the Empire State Building was really for. There were many obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to @CAPS1 on the mast. One problem they faced was that the dirigible landed on the roof would add stress to the building's frame. The stress and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation of the building. This means the building would have to be modified and strengthened. Safety was also a big issue for the mast. Because the dirigibles used hydrogen, it could catch on fire and be destroyed over a densely populated area. Another obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting. This made the back of the ship swivel around. Lastley, it was not successful is because of the law against airships flying too low. Before the constructors built all this extra to the building they should have thought of all the defects it could have."
