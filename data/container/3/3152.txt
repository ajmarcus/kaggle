"Right from the start, the Empire State Building had architectural demands that posed several obstacles for the builders of it, especially when it came to building the mooring mast for dirigibles. Initially, the Empire State Building was built only for inside use, so the mast would add stress to the buildings frame and possibly damage it. Secondly, the Empire State Building was built in a very densely populated area so if any malfunctions were to occur such as the Hindenburg in 1937, many people could be killed down below. Another problem posed to the mooring mast was nature itself. Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, and they were very strong as well so any dirigible mounting on the building was threatened by swiveling and flying off when landing. The masters in the architectural era had made a true mistake when they planned the construction of the Empire State Building, and it never could have reached its potential for many obvious reasons."
