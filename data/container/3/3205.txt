"The future of transportation is a matter that any architect has discussed at one point. Whether reality is taken into account, that is another subject. Al Smith had the challenge of make the dream of docking dirigibles, into a reality. Although Smith had high hopes for the project, many obstacles stood in the way of the construction of the dock. One problem is stated in paragraph fourteen, ""the greatest obstacle to a sucsesful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Wind power was not taken into account at the time, and neither was the fact that thousands of people in downtown New York are put in danger. In conclusion, dirigibles soon became much more useless with the spark of the airplane and soon died along with the dreams of the mooring mast.Another problem that stood in the way was a law stating, that airships cannot fly to close to urban areas. This destroyed any plans of the mast because not only was it risky to build, but it was also illegal. What was once a glimphs of the future soon turned into nothing as @PERSON1 finally confronted the public in saying that the construction will be post-poned. The future of transportation took a sharp blow, but with the new succession of the airplane, anything seemed possible."
