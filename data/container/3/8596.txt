"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the over all mood is happiness. ""The congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote explains how much he loved his child hood home. The last sentence in the memoir which says ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."", really shows how much he apreciates his parents hard work in the home they made for him. The author of this memoir seems to look back on his childhood happily though his family struggled finantially and personally."
