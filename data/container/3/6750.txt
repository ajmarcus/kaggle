"The author concludes with that paragraph because it expresses and continues the theme of perserverance and adapting to change. The conclusion mentions the test again. From the reading, one can conclude that this test that the author refers to is Saengs confrontation of memories of home without feeling the breakdown from loss. Saeng says earlier in the story that she failed the test, having broken down in tears after looking at all the Familiar plants that had been at home. By concluding with this paragraph which says she will take the test again, it shows that Saeng is going to continue to try to adapt to her new home and feel at peace here, instead of feeling the tremendous loss of her old home. It shows the theme of perserverance because she is going to take the test again and try to overcome the feeling of sorrow."
