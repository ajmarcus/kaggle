"The mood of the memoir is one of greatfulness and of @CAPS1. This is because the auothor, Narciso Rodriguez says, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" In this quote is saying straigh up how he feels, which is grateful. You can also tell that he is implying that he loves his parents. Another quote that supports my main idea is The author says, ""... There is no way to express my gratitude..."" In this quote, just like the last one the author is saying directly how he feels, which is again greatful. In conlcusion the author uses effective techniques to trap the reader in his mood, which is greatful and @CAPS1."
