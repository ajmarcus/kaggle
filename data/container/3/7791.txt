"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, there is a clear mood created by the author. For instance the Cuban background set the mood of happiness. Narciso explains, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I'm eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This shows her love and happiness from her Cuban background. Also another mood set by the author is greatfulness. Narciso explains, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso is clearly greatful for her parents for leading and guiding her life to happiness. In conclusion, Narciso Rodriguez creates the moods of happiness, and greatfulness throughout the memoir."
