"The mood the author creates in the memoir is gratefulness. The author creates gratefulness by repeatedly saying what his parents gave him and that he is grateful for it. First he talks about how he is grateful his parents got him interested in cooking. In paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their... love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This shows the author is grateful for his parents showing him to love cooking. Another time the author is grateful is in paragraph @NUM2. It says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows the author is grateful for his parents' endurance to come to @LOCATION1. In conclusion, the mood the author creates in the memoir is gratefulness. He was grateful for his parents giving him all they could."
