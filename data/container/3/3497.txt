"Based on the excerpt, it is clear that the builders of the mooring mast atop of the Empire State Building faced multiple problems. To begin, the excerpt states that dirigibles from other countries were often filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. The danger of hydrogen was demonstrated when the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" burst into flames. The Hindenburg incident could have been far worse if it had happened in a densely populated area, such as New York City. Aside from the Fire @CAPS1 the mooring mast would create, there was also a ban on low flying aircraft so in densely populated areas. According to the excerpt though, the greatest obstacle was ""Nature itself."" This was a reference to the powerful winds and violent gusts found at the peak of the Empire State Building. With those winds, it would be outstandingly difficult to control a dirigible safely. After realizing all of these complications and obstacles, it was decided that the mooring mast would not be built."
