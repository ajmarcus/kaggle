"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. The architects could not just drop a mooring mast on the top. If they did, the whole building's foundation would have to be changed. Nature was also a major reason to stop the project. The wind currant were always changing and the blimp would swirl around. Safety was the greatest reason to shut down the job. Hydrogen is very flammable and if the blimp, which would be over New York was to burst into flames many people would be killed. In conclusion, these obstacles are why the builder stopped and didn't complete the project for the Empire State Building."
