"In the memoir from ""Home: The blueprints of our lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood of this seems to be overjoyed, and happy. His life so far in @LOCATION1 must be great. For example, Narciso talked about how his sense of ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Also, about passionate cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. As well as the love and sacrifice of his parents that was given to give him a better life. But most of all the mood gets serious at times, like when he talked about how his parents turned the simple house he lived in into a home. Then, how it was in @LOCATION1 he learned the real definition of the word ""family"", and how to love, etc. In conclusion, the memoir jumped from overjoyed and happy into very serious and real."
