"The mood created by the author in the memoir was happiness and being thankful because in the memoir in paragraph @NUM1 when he is saying ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. It means that it doesn't matter if you aren't blood related because it only matters if you have love for one another and you care about one another. Narciso is just saying that he is proud of what he is today, and loves and respects his culture, and that he has people to love and has people who love him back."
