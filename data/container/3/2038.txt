"In the passage ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, the obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are brought out. The author brings our ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"". The climate and winds were constantly changing at the height of the building. The back of the dirigibles would then swivel which could very well be dangerous. Also the builders had to take into account the fact ""most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, & hydrogen is highly flammable."" The Empire State Building is in the middle of New York, a highly populated State. The explosion of a dirigible at the top of the Building would be very dangerous & would lose a lot of lives. The builders of the Empire State Building under went many challenges in trying to allow Dirigibles to dock."
