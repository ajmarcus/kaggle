"The mood that Narciso Rodriguez protrayed very strongly in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is gratitude. In the memo I @CAPS1 mentions how thankful @CAPS1 truly is to his parents for giving him a life of family, and happiness, love etc. For example @CAPS1 thanks them for their ""rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am extremely grateful)."" Narciso is grateful in a way @CAPS1 could never be able to show them his gratitude. ""... I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity..."" Narciso ""will always be greatful to his parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 is greatful for what they did for a better life, for showing him happiness, family, love and sacrifice. Overall the main mood of this memoir is gratitude."
