"Builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A one thousand-foot dirigible, attached to a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings framed if the dirigible was placed at the top of the building. The buildings frame would have to be strengthened and modified to accommodate the situation. Over @MONEY1 worth of modifications would have to be installed into the framework. some other obstacles builders faced was the safety. The dirigibles ran on hydrogen which is flammable. Another obstacle was the weather. The winds shifted at the top of the Empire State building were shifting due to violent air currents. One last obstacle was an existing law that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. The idea of a dirigible quietly disappeared."
