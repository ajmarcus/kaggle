"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, it gives a cheery, happy safe mood. Paragraph @NUM1 explains a traditional cuban home, with the cooking and music and everything. It's like that in my house, just with @CAPS1 things, not Cuban. Also, the narrator explains how everyone in the neighborhood was a close - knit family of Cuban, spanish and Italian people. No one would hurt one other and every one will help in case of a problem, giving a safe feeling. Lastly, All of paragraph @NUM2 and @NUM3 explains how his parents risked everything to be in the @CAPS2. My parents did the same thing and it makes me feel happy that they did. So, its probably the same for the narrator. In conclusion, the memoir has a good and happy mood to it."
