"It is actually a very powerful last statement, Even though she failed her drivers test, she has realized that she will just have to keep being strong and be patient. Soon the geese will come back and the snow will melt, and she will return to take her test and will  be determined to pass. Saeng  bought the hibiscus to feel as if she were back in Vietnam, and felt as if it could fill that place in her heart were she misses it. I paid nineteen dollars for  it. She  says it like she was disappointed  in failing the  test but also that saying which is free back in vietnam was so expensive in the united states. A hibiscus flower is tropical so when it blooms in the spring will be when she becomes ready to give the test a second try."
