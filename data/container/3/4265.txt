"In the essay, the cyclist is greatly affected by the features of the setting. Under the conditions he could barely survive and make it to his destination. It is clear that the features of the setting are affecting him when he states,“The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can be so cruel.” In his efforts he is slowly getting weaker and the sign he sees only makes him feel worse because it seems to him that it mocking him. He also states, “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you had left to circulate. With any luck I’d hit a bump and ledge one in my throat.” This shows he is ready to give up completely and wouldn’t care if he died. From the author’s tone, it is clear that the features of the setting do affect the cyclist."
