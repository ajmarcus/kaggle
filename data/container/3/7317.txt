"The mood I felt when I read the @CAPS1 Narciso Rodriguez was a feeling of togetherness. I got this mood because he is always talking about being together with his family and how the home he was brought up in truly brought everyone in his family together and this made him proud of his family and his Cuban Culture. His family meant a lot to him so another mood could be love because of his love for his family and the house he grew up in where he learned to love. His parents did a lot for him and, ""Turned their simple house into a home"". He learned everything he could ever think about from his parents and he loves them a lot. These are the moods I felt while reading Narciso Rodriguez."
