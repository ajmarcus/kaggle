"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, Rodriguez created a mood of gratefullness toward his mother and father. Numerous times, he wanted to thank his mother and father. For example, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance."" @PERSON1 is so grateful for his parents because they left Cuba to start a new life in @LOCATION1. They sacrificed leaving their friends and family behind. In the text, it says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life..."" His parents sacrificed so much just to give rodriguez a better life and thats why he creates the mood of gratefullness in his memoir."
