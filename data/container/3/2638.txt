"Based on the excerpt the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that a ""thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by single cable tether would add stress to the buildings frame."" This is a very important obstacle because of the frame becomes to stressed by excess wait of the dirigible the building might collapse. another obstacle is wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This is also a major obtacle because the dirigibles were very light lighter than air so the violent winds would swing it arond that high in the air is not a safe thing especially considering that downtown @CAPS1 is below were there are thousands of people. And a third obstacle was the Law against airships flying to low over urban areas. This made it illegal to fly that low, to be able to tie the blimp up to the building."
