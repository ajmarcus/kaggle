"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there The higher calling for which the mooring mast was built was to put New York on the forefront of modern travel; the builders then, needed to solve some obstacles that were on their way. First was that the building itself needed to get stronger in order to support ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building"" As a result, the frame of the Empire State Building needed to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the problem. According to the excerpt, @MONEY1 worth of changes had to be made to the building's framework. Another problem was that of the stress of the wind pressure The wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. This was also solved, at least they thought, by making a few changes to the skeleton of the building. Lastly, was that the building needed a space to provide for passengers that were to come from the ""blimps"". To solve the problem, they built a shaft to bring passengers down to the @NUM1 floor, where baggage and ticket areas would be located. The builders had to face many problems even before attempting to build a mast for dirigibles to dock at."
