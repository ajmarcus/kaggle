"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast, written by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems with their ideas. The builders thought they would be able to make a successful landing dock for dirigibles. Everything they did was all planned right but when it came time to test it, it didn't work. There were quit a few problems with there idea of using the Empire State Building is a landing dock for dirigibles.One reason that this one not successful was because the dirigibles wern't able to get close enough to attach the building In order for the dirigible to be ankered would be for a rope to be tied to some thing. But the balloons wern't able to get to close to the building because the point at the top of the building was making it too hard. If it got to close to the point, it could puncture the balloon which would not be could because the gas that holds it up would come out and the balloon would fall. There is one more major reason they're plan did not work.The other major reason would be because of the wind. the wind would get so wild the back of the blimp would sway back and forth, making it dangerous for passengers. They wouldn't be able to weigh it down with weights would be dangerous for the pedestrians down in the city @CAPS1 of the major reasons why the plan to dock dirigibles at the empire state building would not work."
