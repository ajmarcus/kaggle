"Narciso Rodriguez, a clothing designer, wrote a memoir on his ideas about family. I believe the author set a very personal mood in this story. This is not unexpected considering it is a memoir however there were few statement facts and everything was personal experience. Along with personal the memoirs also show a very loving and happy lifestyle they lived. For example there was always Cuban music playing along with Cuban food and the parents would always host a person in the house is time to get back on their feet. Above all the author clearly shows his love for his parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" With this the author clearly shows the mood for love and happiness."
