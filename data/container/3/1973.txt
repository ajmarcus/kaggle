"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock atop it.One major obstacle was safety, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the [@LOCATION2] used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". The owners quickly realized how dangerous an accident would be ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"".The second major obstacle was nature; ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". A thousand-foot dirigible moored atop the building would add enormous stress to the frame of the building.In the end these two obstacles would be too great. Times were changing and with the air plane taking over modern travel the dirigible and the mooring mast were doomed."
