"Obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were problems such as strong winds a weak structure and public safety. The strong winds would almost make it imposible to hold it steady at the top while the weak structure would almost make it imposible to hold saflley at the top. with all of these hazards it is compleatly unsafe for people to ride, dock, and board these massive dirigibles at the top of the Empire State Building."
