The author of this memoir presented a kind of grateful and cheerful mood. I believe it is this type of mood because in the memoir he talks so much about on how that he is so grateful that his parents were so caring and selfless people because they moved from their home country cuba just for the sake of their children. He presents the cheerful mood by focusing all the good things in his life with his parents in his house and neighborhood. Example's are him talking about how all the cultures got along good with one another in his area. He also talked about the good times he had with his parents in the kitchen. The memoir he left was definetly a pausitive one not a negative one.
