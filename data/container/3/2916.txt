"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to face. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"". This is stating that the stress of the dirigibles and its shiftyness will put stress on the buildings foundation and they don't want that stress to topal over the building. Also they say ""The winds on the top of the biulding were consistantly shifting due to the violant air current"". this says that they are worried  that the wind might take the balloon away from the building causing it to injure people these are only a few obsticals the builders had to face."
