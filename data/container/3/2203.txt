"There were several obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building. First, if a dirigible was ""moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The framework was not strong enough for this. But the main reason was safety. It was known that most foreign dirigibles used ""hydrogen rather than helium"", which is highly flammable. Things wouldn't go well if there was an incident in a populated place like New York. Also, the winds causing the ship to swivel around, and lead couldn't be used to weigh it down for safety reasons. Finally, there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" which makes it illegal for any dirigible to even come close to a building. All of these reasons contributed to why docking dirigibles would come with many obstacles."
