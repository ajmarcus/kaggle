"In the story, Do not exceed posted speed limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist faces many hardships on his way to Yosemite due to the features of the setting. The fact that it was a hot summers day contributed to his hardships. With little water, it was easier for him to get dehydrated. In the text, the author writes, .I could drop from heat stroke, on a gorgeous day in June. (Kurmaskie, @NUM1). This lets the reader know that the heat of June was very dangerous to the cyclist. There was also nobody around except Old timers who havent left the confines of their perches since water was in offing (Kurmaskie, @NUM2). The narrator stresses his viewpoint on taking directions from these people since their directions are as poor. It can be inferred that he meant they was obviously out of date when across directions since the ones they gave him were not correct. The cyclist in this story had a rough time getting to his destination due to the setting."
