"The mood created in this memoir is excilent. For example in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This gives me the feeling of thankfulness and to really admire what my parents have done for me. Another example is in paragraph @NUM2 it says ""It was here I learned the real definition of family."" This quote makes me feel so happy that I have a family that supports me and is always there for me. This memoir really changed how I look at things and made me relize how thankful I am to have my family."
