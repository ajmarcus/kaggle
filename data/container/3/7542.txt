"In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez he created a mood of happiness and joyfulness. Narciso Rodriguez creates this mood by showing the generosity his parents have towards their son, family and friends. I also feel another mood that Narciso expresses is love.iI say this because his parents sacrifice everything they had because they wanted a better Life for their son. ""The faith that this struggle with lead them and their children to better times dove them to endure these hard times"". In this quote is love. Narciso's parent's new that for him to have a better life they would need to sacrifice thirs. That is why i feel love is a mood protrayed in the memoir."
