"There are several features of the setting which affect the cyclist one is the fact that he is traveling on a hot day in June. and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June. The heat was getting to the cyclist and he was scared he might get heatstroke. The terrain was also not very ideal for a cyclist on a hot @DATE1. I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. The cyclist was tired and the hills were making it worse. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. The cyclist was running out of water quickly and there was nowhere close to get more. These glitches in the setting affected the cyclist because it was extremely hot, he was running out of water and there was rough terrain. The setting was not in the cyclist's favor."
