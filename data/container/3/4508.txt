"Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit is an inspiring and almost humorous essay it take the reader inside a journey in a cyxlist daily routine. In this story the author fights dehydration as he tries to make to a national park with shortcut directions from old timers the setting of this storygreatly affects the cyclist and the pitty the reader feels for him. Half way through the essay, the biker had already traveled roughly @NUM1 miles; thats extremely crazy. The fact that he is travelling through California deserts in June is even harder to believe. The first time he mentions the setting, he states he is in a ghost town, two sentences after he states that the sun was beating down. At that point he wasnt really bothered. Another description of his setting that probably affected his ability to peddle was when he states flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. He was already dehydrated and had already traveled so far, the rocky roads probably didnt help his journey much. The setting basically made the story. If he wouldnt have been peddling in the desert, it would have just been another trip in his life. The setting makes the reader see what cyclist really go through. "
