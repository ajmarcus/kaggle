"Although Al Smith had expected the mooring mast of the Empire State Building to be unique and practical, builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, in order for the building to accommodate the stress that the dirigibles would add to the building's frame, the framework of the building had to be modified. This cost over sixty thousand dollars. In addition, dirigibles used hydrogen-a highly flammable gas. An accident could be fatal in a densely-populated area like New York City. Also, there were violent winds at the top of the building that would making docking difficult and could possibly blow a dirigible into the side of the building, causing it to be punctured. Finally, an existing law prohibited airships from flying to low over urban areas; it would be illegal for a ship even to approach the building's area."
