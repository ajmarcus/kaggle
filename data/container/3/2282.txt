"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such obstacle was the amount of modifications that needed to be made to the building's framework, as stated in paragraph @NUM1. The other obstacle they faced was the fact that most countries outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, this made it impossible for dirigibles to stop in a densely populated area such as downtown New York, as stated in paragraph @NUM2. A last obstacle they faced was existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. These are the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building."
