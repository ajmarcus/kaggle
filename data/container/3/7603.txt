"In today's aspects, @PERSON1 wouldn't be considered wealthy, but underneath material, he is more wealthy than most people will ever be. For example, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a relative."" Family is very valuable, and a great wealth to Narciso, and throughout the memoir he keeps bringing the feelings of family. It's seem like that emotion was give that held everything together and would make it all ok! He also experiences great gratitude towards his parents and his neighbors; ""But in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit and generosity impressed on me at a such an early age and be demonstration or how important family and friends are."" I think the overall mood of this memoir is very warm, and optemistic about life. They make the best of their situation, and that really made an impression on Narciso. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" "
