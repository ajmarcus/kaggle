"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lsted, The builders had to face many obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. Though this idea was not successful, it took them a long time to realize the causes and effects of docking dirigibles. over sixty thousand dallors were spent on modifications for the building. after fixing the structure of the building the builders found out the weather had interfered. Because of the high winds the dirigibles were constantly shift. There wasn't a safe way to control shifting. Their was also a law against airships flying too low over populated cities. another reason was, dirigibles were very dangerous and highly flammable. Trying to build a mooring mast was not a good idea."
