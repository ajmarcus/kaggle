"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" written by Marcia Amidon lüsted she explained the challenges dirigibles faced when trying to dock to the Empire state building. The @CAPS1 had to take into account the obstacles of the make up of dirigibles, the building structure and weather conditions when attempting to create a landing area for dirigibles. A mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building could never be functional. Dirigibles must be lighter than air to fly. Gases such as helium and hydrogen are used to make blimps less dense. Being highly flamable, hydrogen could easily create a massive fire. The owners of the Empire State Building, decided if the blimp ever caught on fire it would be a much larger disaster over an area with a large population. Another factor that halted the docking of dirigibles was the building structure. The docking of a dirigible adds extra stress to the Empire State Building. The @CAPS1 were forced to design the framework of the building so it was strong enough to not collapse under the extra pressure. This took time and ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications hat to be made to the buildings frame work"". Lastly weather conditions tested the @CAPS1, on the top of the Empire State Buildings the winds are quite unpredictabled. They often shift because of ""violent air current"". No matter how the builder tie the dirigible to the mast the blimp will be unsafe. Due to winds, and structure of the building as well as blimp, the @CAPS1 couldn't create a docking area for dirigibles on the Empire State Building."
