"Attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building created many obstacles for its builders. Some of which weren't even discovered until finally attempting to do it.The first of the builders problems started with trying to prepare the actual building for the added stress that would be applied when having dirigibles try to dock. They spent @MONEY1 on modifications to reinforce the framework of the building. Then ""Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower..."" This created lots of unnecessary work for the workers, as well as made obstacles.There was also a lot of danger associated with docking dirigibles that the builders had to deal with. The violent changing air currents would require them to make the mast as sturdy as possible and account for the movement of the dirigibles. Finally the builders find out the biggest obstacle which is that it is legal for airships to fly that low over urban areas, so technically they weren't even allowed to do what they did. Thinking back on it, it is obvious to see that ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose..."""
