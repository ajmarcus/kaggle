"The setting affect is used to a great extent in the short story “Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit” The cycleist had beed going for a very long time when he came to the first town and there was no water At this point you can tell that he has lost confidence the “old timers"" directions. From this quote; “a ton-like substance oozed out.” This quote shows how after @NUM1 miles of pedaling when he was supposed to have come to two towns by that point his one chance of water had been depleated. The next time the setting affect is used is when he comes for a building that was rusted out. He said, “I hung my head” this shows how he almost completely lost all hope and that he was sure that he is going to die."
