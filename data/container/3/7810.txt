"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez describes his family factually, as well as loving and inviting. In paragraph two, Narciso tells how his family interacted in their house. ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey."" Here, Narciso lists the facts about his childhood. The memories he shared with his family during that time makes the mood for loving. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" His parents shared their love and compassion with everyone else, and that is what Narciso is grateful for; for the love and sacrifices his parents made for him. The powerful words he uses in the last two paragraphs puts the memoir into a mood of love and perhaps even sadness. The word he uses can tell they are from the heart, the memories of @CAPS1 parents as well as the rest of his family, influenced his life, and he learned the true meaning of family."
