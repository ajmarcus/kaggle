"The features of the setting affect the cyclists mood towards the journey. At first, he is confident that the old mens knowledge of the land is accurate and he is excited about what lies ahead for him. However, his excitement soon turned into dismay and slight doubt as his journey drags on. The heat of the weather and lack of water makes the cyclist develop an uncaring matter. Id read once that sucking on stones helpswith any luck Id hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. The verbal irony in this passage delivers a negative feeling to the reader and it is here that it is clear that the cyclist doesnt care what happens to him. When he finally reaches a sign of civilization, the cyclist becomes himself again and decides that his knowledge is best."
