They based their lives on family and happiness inside their home. He said that ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors open."" this shows that if family or friends needed help they were there for them. It also stated people in your family don't have to be blood related and that many people where welcome to eat dinner with them. This shows how nice and how well the neighborhood got along. They would also surround themselves with Cuban food and music show that they where proud of who they were and that they made their new home a nice and piecefull environment."
