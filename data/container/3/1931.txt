"Al Smith, a former governor of New York had a brilliant idea to make the empire state building, the tallest building in the world.  He would put a mooring mast on the top to @CAPS1. dirigibles to the top so the dirigibles could let passengers off here.  But, this plan had many @NUM1, ""The stress of the dirigible's load into the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation"".  This is a problem because if the mast was just placed on the building, it would destroy itself.  Another problem is that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen.""  Hydrogen is a very flamable gas, and would put the whole section of the city underneath the Zeppelin at risk.  The third Reason was an existing law which prevented airships from flying too low in urban areas."
