"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted the @CAPS1 face huge obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building. First ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" The Reason for that is because the ""winds atop the building were allways changing due to the violet air currents"" ""Even if the dirigible were tethered  it would swivil around"" ""Also it would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street it was not practical nor safe"" It would be really dangerase if they proceed in docking atop of the building. Those are the obstacles the buidiers faced."
