"The author created a very grateful/happy mood in the memoir. For example in paragraph @NUM1 when Narciso says ""I will always be greatful to my parents for the love and sacrifice. When he is saying this he is showing he is happy w/ his parents. I the memoir he talks about how he loves his house and why he loves his house and all the great memories in that house and that shows that this memoir mood is a more happy mood instead of sad for example paragraph @NUM2 when he says ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this combo house were a cuban feast always filled the air with not just sent and music but life and love."" Also when he said in paragraph @NUM2 that"" It here where i learned the real defenition of family. And for this i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things i learned there about how to love."
