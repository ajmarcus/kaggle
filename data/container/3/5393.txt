"The author concludes the story with the paragraph because these geese coming back symbolize Saeng’s determination and hope that she needs to pass the driving test. She will wait for the winter to pass so that she can pass the test. The coming of spring also symbolizes renewal and birth. Saeng will have the chance again to pass the driving test with renewed faith and encouragement. This is a great way to end the story because it is really deep and makes the reader think about the meaning of the scene and how the geese, hibiscus plant, and spring arriving effect the conclusion of the story."
