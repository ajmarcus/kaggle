"The mood of this memoir is almost remorseful, remembering his childhood home, his family life that includes his neighbors and extended family Narciso Rodriguez creates a feeling of being home and being surrounded by people you love. He explains how his first friend was his babysitter and the person who lived above him. And his real grandparents were still in Cuba so his downstairs neighbors became his surrogate grandparents. He also creates a mood of having no where to turn when it came to his parents getting jobs in the United States. They had to settle with getting jobs underequiped for their abilitie. His parents, he said ""came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give the children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in the country they loved"". He feels that this is one of the reasons his childhood house was turned into a home."
