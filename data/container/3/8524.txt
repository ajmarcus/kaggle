"The mood in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" was loving, caring, warm, and inviting. The loving atmosphere was created by how much the family really did love each other. The family also loved their Cuban culture. The mood was also caring and friendly. The familes from all different countries cared for one another. I felt that all the people were warm and inviting. Everyone felt that they could trust each other and have each other over for dinner. The Rodriguez family really brought their culture to their new home and Narciso mentioned in the last paragraph that this is where he found out the definition for family while living in this neighborhood. The mood was created very clearly by the author in this memoir."
