"The author concludes the story Winter Hibiscus  this way because she is  creating a sense of hope that Saeng feels for the future. Saeng  was feeling very sad when she was walking home from failing her drivers test. The author describes this scene as The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds. The winter and cold represent Saeng losing hope. When she gets home and shows her mother the hibiscus, her mother says that it is strong enough to make it through the cold months here. This symbolizes Saeng making it through as well. At the end of the story, Saeng  sees geese and realizes that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the qunet  repition of season upon season, almost familiar to her. This shows that she really is adjusting to her new home, and has hope for when spring comes, and the geese return, and hibiscus bloom."
