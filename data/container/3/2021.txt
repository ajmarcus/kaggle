"When attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders had many obstacles to face. Most of the dirigibles used at the time were from countries other than @LOCATION1, so they used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flammable so if it caught on fire it would go down in a very populated area. Another obstacle was at that height, the wind was very strong and violent. When tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the dirigible would be caught by the wind and swing around the mooring mast. The last obstacle was there was a law stating that dirigibles can not fly too low over urban areas this made it impossible for a dirigible to ever come close to the building."
