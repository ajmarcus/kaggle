"The author created a reflective, happy, and grateful mood in the memoir. First, the author states in his memoir, ""I was born into this simple house... which I adore to this day... childhood... first friend."" All these phrases show Narciso reflecting to his childhood, his first friend, and first house. Narciso reflects to his past, like how all memoirs should be. Secondly, the author uses words like ""great sense... adore... grateful,"" to show his appreciation and happiness of his childhood. To my knowledge, there aren't any grave, dark, sad parts of his life in the memoir. Finally, the author says that he is grateful for his rich culinary skills, passed down by his family, and his parents' love and sacrifice. This gives the mood of the memoir appreciation throughout the memoir, especially near the end, where he is grateful for his parents' selflessness. To conclude, the mood of this memoir is appreciation, happiness, and reflective."
