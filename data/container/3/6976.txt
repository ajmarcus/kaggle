"The author concludes the story this way to show that Saeng still has hope to succeed and adapt in this new country. She previously had a lot of home sickness, missing her grandmother and keepsakes from her child hood. The height of her homesickness is seen when Saeng comes back to her house and is explaining to her mother the nature of the hibiscus. “She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.” Saeng is uncomfortable living in @LOCATION1 and wishes to go back to Vietnam. Butt by the end, Saeng’s attitude changes from despair to hope. Even though she has failed her driver’s test. Saeng is determined and hopeful to do at least something in this new country by saying ""...then I will take the test again.” Saeng has changed a good deal within this story and that change in attitude is seen with the exerpt on geese in the last paragraph."
