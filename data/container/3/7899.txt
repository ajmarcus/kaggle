"Narciso Rodriguez creates a very humble, caring, and grateful mood in his memoir.The humility shows when he describes how, although rich and inviting on the inside, his house was simple and ""modest"" on the outside. All of the home's warmth and comfort was crammed into a three-room apartment.The sense of caring was demonstrated throughout the whole memoir in the way that Rodriguez referred to not just his blood-relatives, but the friends and neighbors whom he considered ""family."" Of his parents, he says that they ""always kept their arms and their door open"" to their community.Rodriguez expresses his gratitude again and again, especially in the sixth paragraph. He states that he could never thank his parents enough for the valuable lessons they instilled in him, especially their generosity and sense of community. These three themes set the mood of this memoir."
