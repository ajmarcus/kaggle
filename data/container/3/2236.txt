"When the Empire State Building was created it was supposed to be a ""pit stop"" for dirigibles, known today as blimps. It was meant to be the modern way of travel, but many problems surfaced changing the plans. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This was a major safety hazard! Another problem presented itself ""[A] law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" If anything were to go wrong with the ship many people would be put in danger. The harsh wind nature would provide the risk of puncturing the blimp against buildings; also endangering the people below it."
