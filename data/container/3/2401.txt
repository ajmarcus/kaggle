"When building the Empire State Building, the architects and engineers faced many problems. The first problem was reconstructing the buildings framework. This had to be done in order for the building to be able to undergo great amounts of wind pressure and stress from the dirigible. The next problem the workers encountered was the wind currents. The wind was so strong at the tip of the building, if a dirigible were to be docked to the mooring mast, it would be rotating around it depending on the wind currents. The final problem the architects faced was a law against a dirigible's height. There was an already existing law that stated airships could not fly too low over urban areas. These obstacles were but some of the many faced by the building team of the Empire State Building."
