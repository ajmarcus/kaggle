The obsticals that the builders face in attempting to allow dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building are the law to fly that low to buildings. They also face structural problems in the building to be able to hold a dirigible. They also could not keep the dirigibles from moving because of the wind. They faced safty ishuse because of some dirigibles are filled with hydrogen and it is highly flamable. They did not want to have a fire over a densely populated area. They did not want what happen to the German dirigible Hindenburg in New Jersey to happen in down town New York. Dirigible have never dock there and never will because it is unsafe.
