"In this memoir the mood created by the author is gratefulness, happiness and unity. This is noticeable in many different ways such as when Narciso says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows gratefulness Narciso per trays to his parents for giving up their life in Cuba. Another example of mood in this memoir is when Narciso states ""Here in the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations...."" This passage shows happiness in Narciso's home. It is evident by the tone used by the author that these were happy times. Lastly when Narciso says, ""In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together."" This shows unity in the story despite the different races of people who lived around Narciso. This is how happiness, gratefulness, and unity created a mood in this memoir."
