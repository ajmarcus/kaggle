"In the article Narciso Rodriguez the tone is loving, peaceful and happy. In this memoir it talks about family and friend coming together as one. In the article the best example of happiness and peace is the last sentence, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows joy because they are all together. Another example is in paragraph seven where he says I learned the real definition of family."" This is loving because it shows he is happy and he enjoys being with friends and family. Another reason why the tone is grateful is because he says ""... there is no way I can express my gratitude..."" this is happy because he is thankful for what everyone does in conclusion the tone is happy, loving and grateful"
