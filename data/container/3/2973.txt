"In this excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles in the attemp to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. One of the greatest obstacle was one of safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" An accident where the German dirigible caught fire and was destroyed, shocked the builders, but they realized it could have been worse. Nature itself was also a problem. ""Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The back of the ship would ""swivel"" around even if it was tethered. Also there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. All of these examples would cause the builders to face obstacles."
