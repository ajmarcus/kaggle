"The setting effected the performence of the cyclist and the mood of the cyclist. The rolling hills the cyclist had to get over most likely made him more fined and thirsty because he had to put more effort in to get over them. over one long, crippiling hill, a building came into view. The long, big hills that he had to go up and made him more thirsty, but probably more satisfied when it was all over. Ironically, the building was a grape juice factory; abandoned and rusty, but the sigh featuring a boy drinking a refreshing glass of juice was still noticeable. This brought his hopes down. But continued to move on. In my life, I have never had such an experience to where I had to keep pushing and urging myself to my goal, but the closes I got, the more distractions got in the way to and stop me."
