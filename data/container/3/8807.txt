"In the memoir from ""Home: Blueprints of our lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author stretches the importance of family. The mood that Narciso Rodriguez creates is a comfortable, loving, homey feeling. He states that he grows up learning that ""family has nothing to do with being a blood relative"". He says that his family welcomed everybody. Strangers that needed help, neighbors, and extended family. He creates a loving mood when he said he lived in a ""close-knit community"". He also says ""These cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" @CAPS1, when @PERSON2 says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" you can sense his appreciation and feel the comforting atmosphere. Those were the moods I felt while reading this memoir by, Narciso Rodriguez."
