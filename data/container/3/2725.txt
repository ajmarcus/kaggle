"On December 11, 1929, Al Smith had the idea to make the Empire State Building the tallest building in the U.S.. He wanted to out-do the Chrysler Building, Smith wanted it to be 1,250 feet. His idea was to add a mooring mast. However, issues got in the way such as how highly flamable blimps were, how densely populated the city was, and the violent shifting winds.Blimps are highly flammable because they contain both hydrogen and hellium. on May 6, 1937, German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. New York City has millions of tourists a day, in such a populated area what if something went horribly wrong. The greatest issue was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... the back of the ship would Swivel around the mooring mast."" (@CAPS1, @NUM1).On May 6, 1937 owners of the building concluded that efforts to make the Empire State Building the tallest building was neither practical nor safe."
