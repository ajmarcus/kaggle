"While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast, Empire State Building building faced many obstacles. One problem they encountered was the use of hydrogen in dirigibles rather than the use of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and actually caused a dirigible to be destroyed by fire. Also, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making it difficult for a dirigible to stop swiveling around-a safety hazard for pedestrians below. Lastly, it was illegal for aircraft of any sort to fly so low over urban areas. At first, the idea of the mooring mast was well-liked but in the end it had too many problems and proved to be impractical."
