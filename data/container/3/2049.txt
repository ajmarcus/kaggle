"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles. The first problem was the material of the dirigibles. Dirigibles ""were actually enormous steel frame balloons with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium make them lighter than air."" The first problem is that it's material could be broken if happened to fly into a sharp area of the building, and the ""violent air currents"" did not help. Since the dirigibles could not be weighted down at the Empire State Building, it would be dangerous to have them ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" Another obstacle was the fact that the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen. Although dirigibles from the United States were filled with hydrogen and helium, ""most dirigibles from outside the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" With these obstacles builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there, the theory did not work out in reality."
