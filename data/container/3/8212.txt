"The memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" creates an overall mood of happiness, and some sadness at the same time. In paragraph @NUM1, the author explains what it was like to live in his home in Cuba. The way he describes his experience in the kitchen cooking and listening to music gives the reader a warm feeling. It says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This sentence not only makes the reader happy for him, but they can see unity in his family. In paragraph @NUM2, he also shows how life with his family was. ""It was a close-knit community of hardworking immigrants..."" On the other hand, there's also a part of this story that makes the reader feel sad for him. In paragraphs @NUM3 and @NUM4, he explains the difficult life his parents had moving to @LOCATION1. ""They struggled both personally and financially"" it says in paragraph @NUM3. It's upsetting to read this after hearing of all the great times he had with his parents. That's why the end of the memoir and the beginning have two different moods. Both happiness and sadness are shown in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez."""
