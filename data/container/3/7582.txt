"This memoir definatley has a strong and apperent mood, and that mood stands out to me as Narciso being grateful, he is obiously very thankfull to his parents and family. I know this because the memoir says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" This quote really shows that @PERSON1 is thankfull for his parent's love for him.This mood comes out in the memoir when @PERSON2 says ""But, in reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important Family and @CAPS1 are."" This quote shows how he is thankfull for his Family, but also how his Family shaped him as a person.In all, There are many emotions in this story, but the one that @CAPS2 out to me the most was him being gratefull."
