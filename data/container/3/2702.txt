"The builders of the Empire State Building had obstacles in their way. There were Dirigibles that were one thousand feet long and they had an obstacle which was that they did not have much space in New York to land. Al Smith decided that was a good idea to let dirigibles anchor on top of his building for some hours for ""refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on."" But the dirigibles were docked by an electric winch that tied the ship to the mast. The dirigibles would swing and people would still get on and off safely. Architects and engineers of the Empire State Building worked/talked with experts and got equipment ""and mooring operations oat the U.S. Naval Air Station"". which the navy was the leader in the development of dirigibles in the U.S. and knew everything. The Navy offered its dirigibles to be used for testing the mast. Also the architect met with president of an airship transport company that offered a dirigibles service across the Pacific ocean. so the builders had many obstacles and attempts to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
