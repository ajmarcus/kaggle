"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez From Home: The blueprints of our lives the author sets a sad mood in this memoir. An example of the sad mood set the author describes his neighborhood. The author describes his neighbor hood by saying ""our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, cuban and Italian immigrants."" (@NUM1) This show they live in a run down neighborhood because most immigrants are poor when they arrived at the @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 example is when he describes his family. The author say's ""There was often someone staying with us temporarly until they were able to get back on their feet"". (@NUM2) This shows the poverty that they lived around because they had to put shelter around those who couldn't aford it. The last way the author describes the sacrifice of his parents, The author say's ""The Faith that this would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times"". (@NUM3) This is a sad mood because it shows how their @CAPS2 back fired and they didn't have a very happy time. That is why I think the tone of this memoir is a sad one."
