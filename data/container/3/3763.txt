"In the story, ""Do not exceed posted speed limit, the faetures of the setting effect the cyclist. To keep cool on a hot summer day, is might be neccessary for one to find shade. Just to add to the misfortune of the story. There was no one in eight, not a building, car or structure of any kind."" This factor does not help the cyclist at all, infact, all it does is make the cyclist more  exhausted. Another element in the story that effects the cyclist is the lack of water. Early on in the story the author explains, ""The water bottle contained only a few tatalizing sips."" With more miles to go,the cyclist starts to loose hope of making it to his destination alive. The feature of rolling hills also affects the cyclist. The cyclist is already tired enough, and just to  add to his misfortune, ""flat roads was replaced by short, rolling hills."" @CAPS1 the hills are short, they still could have put impact on him because of the ropolalive hills. Many features of the story effected the mood of the story."
