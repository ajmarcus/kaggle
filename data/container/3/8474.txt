In the memoir the author created the mood of being happy and joyfull. One reason I feel this way is by the way he talks about what goes on in his home. Like when he talks about the hart of the home being the kitchen and how his parents passed on the skills and a love for cooking to him in paragraph @NUM1. Another reason I feel this way is the way he describes the types of friendships he has with is neighborhood. Like in paragraph @NUM2 he talks about how all of the different cultures come together and have great friendships with each other. As I read this it makes me think of all the fun and joyfull things that happened at my house and wonder what else will happen at my house in the future.
