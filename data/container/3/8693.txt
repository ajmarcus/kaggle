"In the memoir ""@PERSON1"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives the author creates a positive, greatful mood. The author ""will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" I know because a writes a few paragraphs just to show how thankful @CAPS1 is to his parents. @CAPS1 describes how great their jobs were in Cuba and then how poor they became in the @LOCATION1, but yet they still worked hard to give their children a better life. ""In a simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country where I celebrated my first birthdays."" @CAPS1 describes everything, as a positive learning experience, but shows that throughout the memoir, the theme is positive and greatful."
