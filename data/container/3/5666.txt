"The author concludes the story with when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts when the geese return and this hibiscus budding, then I will take that test again. The author does this to show how Saeng was able to slowly adjust to change while not forgetting where she came from. This is shown by using symbols of geese and hibiscus together. The geese represent the new home and sounds Saeng had to become adjusted to. While the hibiscus represents the old memories of her past and homeland. Putting the symbols together shows she has come to accept both places. By @CAPS1 that shell take the test again in the spring shows how she will be ready for the change because the test represents how she feels abut @LOCATION1 and by passing the test she allows herself to pass with @LOCATION1 and adjust to the change in her life."
