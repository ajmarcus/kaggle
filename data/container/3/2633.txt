"In the article 'The Mooring Mast' by @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 describes of several problems the builders of the Empire State Building faced in trying to allow dirigibles dock there.For example, most blimps (dirigibles) out side of the United states used hydrogen, rather than helium. Since hydrogen is highly flammable, and since downtown New York is so populated, if anything were to go wrong it could impact the people of New York, resulting in injuries as well as deaths.Another reason is an existing law against flying airships too low over urban areas. This law making it illegal for ship to even approach the area. Overall, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles that could have been noticed before building."
