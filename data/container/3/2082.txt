"In order to let dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building, many changes had to made. The builders and planners both faced many obstacles. First of all, to even consider the idea, they had to ""consult with experts"" which meant taking tours and doing research. They had to find a ""safe way of mooring airships to this mast."" The next obstacle is in paragraph @NUM1. Docking a dirigible to the building would put ""stress"" on the building's frame. The builders had to ""modify and strengthen"" the frame. One of the last obstacles they had to face was designing the tower. The builders eventually decided on a rocket shaped mast with four wings at the corners to house the mooring arm. They had to house the machinery to winch the derigible, too. Overall, the builders had to make drastic changes, spend a lot of money, all for something that wasn't even safe in the end."
