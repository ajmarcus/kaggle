"In the excerpt, there where many obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The problems where that the dirigible being ""held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"", and the wind pressure wouldn't help either, as stated in @CAPS1 @NUM1. Another issue was that, as said in @CAPS1 @NUM2, ""most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium"",... ""hydrogen is highly flammable"", Also in the @CAPS1 @NUM2, ""The owners of the empire state building realized how much worse,"" a accident could be ""if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as down town New York. These are the problems the builders faced."
