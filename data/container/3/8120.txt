"In the memoir what was the mood created by the author.First, I feel that the mood created by the author is both happy and sad. I feel that they are sad because they moved from Cuba to @LOCATION1 where they left all of their friends and family and careers they loved behind. They also struggled both personaly and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. Although they were sad I also felt that they were happy. I thought this because even though they moved from the place they loved they have one thing that made them feel at home. I think that it was there home and each other because they have there home Just as they like like, like when they were back home. I felt that the mood was both happy and sad in this memoir."
