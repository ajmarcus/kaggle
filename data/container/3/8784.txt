"The authors mood of the memoir is that @CAPS1 is grateful because @CAPS1 tells us how much @CAPS1 appreciates of what his parents have done. @CAPS1 appreciates that his parents ""immigrated"" to the United States so @CAPS1 can have a ""better life"". @CAPS1 said that ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country the loved."" @CAPS1 is grateful that his parents did that for him. @CAPS1 is happy that his parents made their house like if they were in Cuba where they originally came from. @CAPS1 said that the ""Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" @CAPS1 is thankful of the ""sacrifice"" that his parents needed to make. @CAPS1 is so grateful that @CAPS1 can't ""express his gratitude"". The author thanks his parents of what they've done to make him happy. That is how grateful the author is towards what his parents did to make them have a better life and @CAPS1 has learned what the word ""family"" truly means."
