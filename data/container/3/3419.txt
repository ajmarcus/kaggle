"During the construction of the Empire State Building the builders experience many obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that the builders cannot just drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building. ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable teather, would add stress to the buildings frame."" Another problem the workers faced is they would have to change the entire design of the building to meet the accommodations of the mooring dock. The largest reason why the dock didn't work out was safety. The author writes ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium..."" This means that the dirigibles are highly flameable and if one exploded over the densely packed New York it would have serious reprocusions. All of these reasons are why the mooring dock never came to life on top of the Empire State building."
