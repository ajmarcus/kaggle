"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous problems dealing with the mooring mast. First of all, I would say safety was the number one issue. If the dirigible were to catch on fire, it could land on the main streets of New York City, posing a hazard to hundreds of pedestrians. Also, the weather was another factor. If it were too windy to fly all the time, then the mast would be a waste. When I read that they had to spend <@NUM1</@CAPS1> to modify the building's framework,""  I started thinking of all the other things a town could do with @MONEY1. There was also an existing law that made it illegal for any airships to be even remotely close to the Empire State Building. Overall, the idea of the mooring mast was just a very poorly planned the idea."
