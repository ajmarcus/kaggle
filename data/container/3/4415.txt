For example, in paragraph four he says “the cool pines and running rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. “ When he says this the reader imagines someone in an ??? more excited as ??? ??? ??? ??? his destination on a dry day.  As the cyclists attitude becomes lower the reader makes the connection what ?? ?? then because of the setting. In paragraph thirteen when the cyclist says, “I wiped the swear from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage and that not to get too excited” the reader can make the connection that it is getting pretty serious for the cyclist to continue as is. Overall as the setting changes to “burning sun” and extremely hot, with a shortage of water the cyclist becomes more sarcastic and less upheat. For example when taking about the rocks in his mouth he states “with only luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat.” This shows a bad mood affected by the features of the setting."
