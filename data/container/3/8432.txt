"In  ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by @PERSON1 the author creates a mood. I think this is the mood of exceptance. @PERSON2 talks about how he grew up in a neighborhood with many other immigrants. Paragraph @NUM1 says ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees celebrate their arrival to this country""... This shows that no matter how diverse people were. the author's family always accepted them and their differences. Paragraph @NUM2 says ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, and knowing they would do the same for us."" This is another example of how loves and accepting the home that Rodriguez grew up in. It also shows how close, kind, and loving this community was in ""@PERSON2"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by @PERSON1."
