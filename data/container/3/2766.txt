"Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, the obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there was how would they be able to have thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, without ""adding stress to the building framework."" They couldn't just add the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof because ""the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have been transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven thousand feet below."" @CAPS1 they had to find a solution, which was to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the Empire State Building. Costing over sixty thousand dollars' worth modifications to the building's framework. Also ""rather than building a utilitarian mast with any ornamentation, they built a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside,"" make the 101st floor a glassed-in observation area and the @NUM1 floor an open observation platform."
