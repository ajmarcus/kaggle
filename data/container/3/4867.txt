"While trying to reach Yosemite by a shortcut, the cyclist faced many challenges and emotions. The cyclist started out his journey cheerfully with thoughts of the cool pines of Yosemite. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cyclist continued on his spirits as well as her water supply going down. The cyclist encouraged himself to keep going, just to find an open building. telling myself that if I could make it that far, Id be fine. @CAPS1 many abandoned factories, the cyclist tried many methods to decrease his thirst including sucking on stones. slowly gaining elevation while losing hope. @CAPS2 the cyclist found a deserted building, he lost more and more hope. When the cyclist found open store with modern bathrooms, he had an overwhelming urge to seek out @PERSON1, kiss them, and buy some bait. At the end the cyclist promised himself to always use his map."
