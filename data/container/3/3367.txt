"In the passage The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @ORGANIZATION2 t buiders of the Empire State Building faced with obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One example is ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state building flat roof. This is saying that you need to have a solid amount of support to hold a dirigible. Another is ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen not Helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. So if that were to catch fire in the middle of New York City That would not be good. Another is the changing wind speeds would cause the dirigible to sway in the air. This could cause issues with stability. So in this passage The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 had to overcome obstacles and attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
