"Based on the excerpt it is evident that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.One of the reasons for the ideas failure was the fact that there was already a law in place making it illegal for a dirigible to even approach the area, as it states in paragraph @NUM1. Also, it could've of been an extreme fire hazard if a blimp had ever reached the Empire State Building. This is proved in paragraph @NUM2, where it states, ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire..."" which caused the owners to realize, ""how much worse that accident could have been in New York."" On top of all this, weather proposed an even bigger problem. Violent air currents made the idea of a mooring mast was ""neither practical nor safe."" I believe the most important reason that the idea failed was because technology was simply advancing beyond predictions. In paragraph @NUM3, it says, ""Dirigibles instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes."""
