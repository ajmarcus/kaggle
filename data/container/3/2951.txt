"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles such as structural support issues, shifting winds, and administrative interference. One major problem arose when they realized the force of holding the blimp in place ""would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"" (par. @NUM1). This meant builders had to make changes to the support system of the building itself before being able to begin construction on the mooring device. Once the mast and reconstruction work completed, builders realize that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (par. @NUM2), which would make docking almost impossible. Attempts to moor became even moor difficult as ""complete dirigible mooring equipment had never been installed"" (par. @NUM3). This shows how builders struggled with bureaucracy in their attempts to build the mooring mast. In conclusion, the shortsightedness of the project caused builders to struggle with the building's structure, weather, and the owners' vision, before ultimately abandoning the mast."
