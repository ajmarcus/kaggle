"The mood in the story is very homely and happiness. The author clearly loved their childhood and was filled by great experiences and a loving background. The author was very greatful for the parents for what they have done. For moving to @LOCATION1, making sacrifices, wanting a better life for them. Also how their home was a great enviroment. always open, cozy, and loving. The mood of the cooking, family coming together, and of the cheerful music is just great."
