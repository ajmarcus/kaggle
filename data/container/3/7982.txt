"The mood the author created in this memoir was very proud. I could tell that the mood was like that because he would always talk about his parents and how they gave up so much to come here. For example in paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""My mother and father came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language Or culture... To give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their family, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" I could @CAPS1 feel the prid in that because he is talking about how his parents left every thing basicly for him. Also, he mentions how his parents opened their arms to who ever needed help even though they were the richest people either. He gave many examples throughout the memoir that strongly showed the mood he made in this memoir, pride"
