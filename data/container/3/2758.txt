"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. When a dirigible was docked, it was held by a single cable tether, adding stress to the biuldings frame. The steel frame of the bilding from top to bottom would have to be modified and strengthened to adress this new situation more than @MONEY1 was spent for modifications on the buildings framework.When the owners of the Empire State building found out about the Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, they realized how much worse it could of bin if it happened right over down town New York. If there was a docking accident and the dirigible was filled with hydrogen then that would be bad for the workers and anyone ealse around the building."
