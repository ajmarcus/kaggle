"In the excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast"" the people attempting to make dirigible docks had ended up with big obstacles in reaching that goal. Before even adding the mooring mast on top of the Empire State building, the workers had to modify the frame or otherwise ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The mooring mast goal was really starting to be dowstable when one problem wasn't realized. Safty, as most of the dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen instead of oxygen, for example ""a German dirigible named Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in lakehurst, New Jersey, since hydrogen is very flamable. Because of realizing this, the situation could've been ""how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place about a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Also ""nature itself"", was the greatest obstacle, as Shifting winds would cause the dirigible to swivel around, even if it makes it to the mooring mast. The dirigibles could use weights, but using them at the Empire State building, ""while they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the Street, was neither practical nor Safe""."
