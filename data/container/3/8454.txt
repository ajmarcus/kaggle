"The mood created by the author in the memoir was thankful @CAPS1 and happyness. He was so greatful for his parents, and how they gave up their whole lives in cuba just to come to america for there kids benefit. They had a good life in cuba, they had good paying jobs, and they had a nice home, and a nice huge family there and i bet they didn't want to leave. but it was something they had to do for their kids benefits. So they moved to america, and they left their home and their good paying jobs, and they also most importantly left their family. that im sure they are going to miss like crazy. In this passage he (the author) was the most thankfull boy ever, and he was thankfull for his parents sacrifice and how they came to this country with such courage and NO knowlage of the language of the culture. but they came to give their children a better life even if it ment leaving behind their family, friends, and carreers in the country."
