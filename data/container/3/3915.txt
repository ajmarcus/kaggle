"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways because its almost like the background and theme of the cyclist The features used in this story are mostly about the background in which he is going and the sites of where he is. Hes showing the reader of how much he needs somewhere to go and also now much hes indespair at the time. When he says It was sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but atleast I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. In this quote he is saying that he @MONTH1 be tired and physically not be in his best shape but atleast he knows hes not in a good shape and he knows hes in trouble, but he can still laugh it off and aware but he keeps trying anyways. This text in my opinion is showing many different ideas such as hope, awareness, and ability and courage to realize you need help but go on anyways to prove to yourself you can finish what you wanted and planned to do."
