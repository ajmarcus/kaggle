"The mood created in the memoir is grateful. ""My Parents both shared cooking duties and unwrittingly Passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today"". What I mean by that is that he is grateful for what he learned from is parents. ""I would always be grateful to my Parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the besis of my life. What I mean about that is that he loves and cherish his mom and dad for what they did for him. The mood in this memoir is grateful because he love and cherrishes and cares about his mom and dad."
