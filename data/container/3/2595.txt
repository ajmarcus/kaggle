"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof."" A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. As stated, modifications had to be made to the building's framework strengthen and accommodate the new situation. Another great obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were consulate shifting due to violent air currents."" This would leave the dirigibles swiveling any air above pedestrians which was neither practical or safe. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles during the project which unfortunately led to the known fact that the Empire State Building was never going to fulfill its purpose."
