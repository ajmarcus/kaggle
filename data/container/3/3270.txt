"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The most influentiel obstacle was nature. According to the passage, ""the Winds at the top of the building were constantly Shifting."" This would make it hard for dirigibles to dock in the first place. If they even succeeded in docking then the back of the dirigibles would shift and float around. The only way to solve that would be to add weights to the back of the dirigibles. Then weights would be floating high above the heads of pedestrians, which ""was neither practical or safe.""Another huge obstacle in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock was the law. At that time there was a law against any kind of aircraft to ""fly too low over urban areas."" As the passage clarifies ""This law would make it illegal for a ship took even tie up to the building or even approach the area."" @CAPS1, the mooring mast idea was dropped."
