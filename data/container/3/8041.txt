"In @PERSON1 from: Home: The Blueprints of our Lives the author creates a warm and loving mood. When @PERSON1 talks about his parents and how they ""always kept their arms and their door open"" that sets a loving mood because if one is so generous and caring to do that, it means they love you and they care about you. Also at the end of the memoir Narciso says that he ""learned there about how to love"". @PERSON1 now says this about his house because his parents were always so up beat and caring that they showed him what love is. Being loved makes all people feel good inside."
