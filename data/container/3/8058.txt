"The author of the memoir is thankful of her parents and to the rest of her family. I know the author is thankful for his parents because in paragraph @NUM1, the author says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, freinds, and careers in the country they loved."" @CAPS1 reason why I think she is thankful for her parents is because they made their liFes worse to make the authors life better. I know this because in paragraph @NUM1, it says, ""In the united states, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever they could find."" The last reason why I know is because he basicly says it in the last sentence of paragraph @NUM3. It says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. That is the authors mood in this memoir."
