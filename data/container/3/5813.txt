"The story is full of emotion and homesickness that it can be a bit depressing, so the author wanted to end with message of hope. After saeng failed the test in the maint shelter of the greenhouse (she) broke down and wept, its inspiring to know that shell keep tryinh despite all her hardship. I know first hand that homesickness can be pretty bad, and finding the strength to keep going and make the promise to take that test again can be very hard but worthwhile .  The author also used the ending to give another meaning to the hibiscus for when the geese return  and the hibiscus is blooming  when the winter is over hard times are past, there will be new hope in a new, beautiful spring.
