"The author creates a gratefull mood in the memoir. For example in paragraph @NUM1 the @NUM2 sentence the author states ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This @CAPS1 that the author is gratefull enough to have parents even though they are not his biological blood related parents. In paragraph @NUM3 In the first @NUM4 sentences the author is talking about how his parents came to this country with carage and without speaking the language or knowing the culture. He also mentioned in those sentences how to give their children a better life meant leaving behind families, friends and careers in their original country. This @CAPS1 that the author is also generous because he realizes the love and sacrafice it takes to do this. Also, In paragraph @NUM5 sentence @NUM4 he says that he has told his parants that what they did was brave because he would have never been able to do what they did. It really displays how grateful the author is, and how much he admires his parents."
