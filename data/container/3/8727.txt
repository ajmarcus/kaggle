"     In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez speaks with nothing but warm fondness and gratitude as she describes her childhood home. The loving way she talks about her parents' appartment and their kitchen and the Cuban culture they combined into their everyday lives suggest that Narciso has wonderful memories of her parents. Obviously, she is very grateful for everything her parents did for her and the chance for her to grow up in such a tender community - where ""'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" (@NUM1) The entire memoir is written with such care and attention to sweet detail. The author clearly feels blessed that her parents sacrificed their safety in their homeland to bring her to @LOCATION1 in order for her to live a better life, to experience the importance of friends and family, and to learn about the true meaning of love through Cuban culture."
