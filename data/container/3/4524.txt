"Poor directions heat, and lack of water affect the cyclist in the story. At the beginning of the story, the cyclist is confident in the directions which would, Òslice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park.Ó  As the story progresses, the cyclist is no longer so confident. The Òheat of the California, June day causes him to be fluent in drinking water.Ó I had been hitting my water bottle pretty regularly, and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.Ó This lack of water is a big problem for the cyclist, so big that he was near heat stroke. ÒI eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.Ó He braved the elements and forced himself on, with hopes that any source of water would reveal itself to him. His perseverance paid off. ÒThen , as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me. The cyclist had found a barst shop and recteved water."
