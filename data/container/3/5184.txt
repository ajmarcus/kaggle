"As the setting changes in the story, so does the cyclists narrators mood. His mood changes from happy and confident to indifferent and scared. At first the cyclist is so happy about Yosemite that he is just care free and no worries at all. He says that, I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face. Even at his first ghost town he just chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on. After this point he could not be so care free. After this town he came to, One ramshackle shed, several thirsty pumps, and men. He said, this was troubling, it was very hot and he had been drinking his water pretty often. He said that, He failed on."" He started to get sort of scared he realized that he could, ""drop from a heatstroke."" He was scared that because of his idea to believe the old men he might possibly die. He finally get happy when he reaches the bait shop and he got his drink. From then on the stock to his map. His attitude changed greatly throughout the story."
