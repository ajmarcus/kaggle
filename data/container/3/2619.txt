"Based on the excerpt, some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced on letting things dock there was the law against air ships, safety and nature. There was a law that said that air craft's weren't allowed to fly that low. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" Also it was unsafe due to the hydrogen in the dirigibles. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Nature was a factor because of the high winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Due to the obstacles that the engineers never thought of, the Empire wtate building never became a dirigible landing."
