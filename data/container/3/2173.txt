"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon LŸsted, it describes many ways the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. It was hard enough for the builders to build the Empire State Building but on top of that they must make a mooring mast at the top. Four term governor of New York Al Smith said it best, ""One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring out some safe way of mooring airships to this mast."" Another obstacle builders faced was having a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, only held by a single cable tether, was simply not safe. With this being said, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened, costing over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications. No matter how the builders built the Empire State Building they still face nature as an obstacle. These are examples builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
