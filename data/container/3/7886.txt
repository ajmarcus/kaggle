"There are many times in the memoir when author created a mood. One time that the author created a mood was when he described a traditional cuban home. In which the kitchen is the heart of the home. Also when the cuban music mixes with the aromas of the kitchen. This gives off the mood of hunger for great food. Another time when the author created a mood was when he described how he lived in a close-knit community. This shows how the author grew up helping people. While being helped in return. This gives the mood of wanting to help someone in need. A third time the author created a mood was when he described his parents as caring people. His family always helped people who were considered family to them. This creates the mood of hope because his family knew that other people would do the same for them. Clearly, there are many times when the authour creates a mood for the reader."
