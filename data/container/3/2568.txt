"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are that dirigible use different gases to stay aloft. As stated in paragraph 6, The first obstacle the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building is ""To their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" From paragraph @NUM1 it states that if a mooring mast was to be droped to the roof of the building and a single cable tether would add stress to the building and pressure would cause them having to modify the building and framework, which cost over sixty thousand dollars. In other words most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Also from paragraph @NUM2 the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds would cause constantly shifting from air current. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."
