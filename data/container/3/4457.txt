"When the man began cycling he thought that this was going to be an easy for ride. For example in paragraph @NUM1 he says ÒThings began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.Ó As he got further he realized that he was in the middle of nowhere. The scenery was getting more and more empty. There was eventually nothing. The scenery was putting down his hope of ever getting out of the desert. For example: In paragraph @NUM2 it states, Òa large highway sign jumped out of me. It read: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.Ó He realized this was going to be hard. He had to travel in bumpy roads and pass snakes without getting bit. The scenery created a sense of hopeless because it was abandoned. When he saw the bait shop, his spirits lifted and he was now hopeful and relieved."
