"In the story, “Winter Hibiscus,” by @PERSON1, a teenage girl; Saeng, and her family, have moved to united states from Vietnam. Saeng is walking home after failing her driver's test, and she passes a familiar plant. She then goes into a florist shop to purchase the plant. She arrives home and tells her mother she failed the test of course her mother is upset, but she makes dinner and the plant the “winter hibiscus” at the end of the story Saeng thinks to herself, ”when they come back, in spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” I think Saeng says she will retake the test in spring because she feels confident and happy now that she is comfortable with the plant she has, and her mother isn't too mad at her. She feels that everything is going to be ok and she can retake the test in spring, when life is blooming."
