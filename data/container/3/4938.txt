"In ''Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,'' by Joe Kurmaskie, the author depicts the vivid details of the setting and how they contribute to the cyclist’s condition. For example, the author wrote “Over one long, crippling hill, a building come into view. I wiped the sweat from my eye” The way the author described the hill as “crippling” should how much energy it was taking away from the cyclist. Another quote that contributed to the cyclist’s journey was, “that smoky blues tune ''Summer time” rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating brain.” This expressed how dehydrated the summer heat way making him. I believe the author used modifying details to support the description of the cyclist’s condition. I think the description of the setting enhanced the reader’s perception of the cyclist’s journey.   "
