"The mood created by the author is a happy mood. I think that it is a happy mood because Narciso is describing his life, and at the end he says he has a happy life. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). I think that this is a happy statement because he is saying that his parents cared so much for him, and they turned what could have been a bad house, into a home. I think that it is a happy mood because of the way he talks about his neighbors. ""It was a close  knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). I think that since he talks about his friends and neighbors so well that it is a happy neighborhood. A @NUM3 and final reason I think it is a happy mood is because of the way he speaks of his family. ""They came selflessly to give their children a better life I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice"" (@CAPS3 @NUM4 and @NUM5). I think that he loves his family, and love is definitely a happy word."
