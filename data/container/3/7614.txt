"In this selectian family is being defined, and Narciso Rodriguez gives it a whole new definition. Narciso Rodriguez is now a recognized clothing designer, but as a child she also had a great life ful of laughter and love. She grew up in a two family home within Newark, New Jersey. I can now smell, hear, and picture  the inside of where Narciso grew up. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today, and for which I am eternally gratefull."" This sentence gives me an image of that happy family and puts me in a good mood, While it reminds me of my our family and the memories that we share among our kitchen. Passionate Cuban music, which I adore to this day, filled the air mixing with the aromas in the kitchen. This sentence puts me in a really excited mood because it reminds me of when my own house is filled with loud music during the summertime. Narciso Rodriguez definitily created a mood in this selection, and it was a good one."
