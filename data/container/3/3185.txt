"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were safety, existing laws, and the changes in air currents. Many of the dirigibles ""from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@NUM1). The owners of the Empire State Building realized that a much worse situation would happen it were to catch on fire ""above a densely populated area"" (@NUM1). Another practical reason why dirigibles cald not moor at the top of the building was that there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (@NUM3). The airship would be ""dangling  high above pedestrians on the streets"", which is pretty unsafe (@NUM4). The last obstacle that the builders faced was the shift in air currents on top of the building. If the dirigibles were tied to the mooring mast, ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around""(@NUM4). This could be dangerous for pedestrians on the street, as well as passengers coming on and of the dirigildes. These practical reasons called for the idea of the mooring mast to be diminish."
