"The obstacles that the builders of the empire state building aced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were, structural problems, breaking laws, and keeping the dirigible safe in the air.  The structural problems this would have caused was the pressure on the buildings foundation from being pulled by the dirigibles.  The builders were also breaking The Law because there is a law saying how low an airship can fly over an urban area, the dirigibles would be way too low.  The final obstacle for the builders was to keep the dirigible safe in the air.  This is due to the high winds the airship would be swinging around and could break off.  Another issue would be if it blew up the pieces would fall onto downtown New York City."
