"In the essay Do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. First, the sun is making the cyclist hot and dehydrated. He states The sun was beginning to beat down, @CAPS1, the sun was a big factor on the affect on the cyclist. Also, the hills of the country roads. Going up and down hills take alot of work you have to use alot of energy. The cyclist says @CAPS2 were replaced by short, rolling hills. @CAPS3, there were snakes in the road, which make the cyclist timid looking out for snakes so he would not get bit. Againg the cyclist states dimond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. @CAPS4, there was an old factory that gave the cyclist hope and then crushed his hopes. The factory even made him more thirsty. @CAPS1, there were many affects on the cyclist due to the setting."
