"In the excerpt Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, The author sets a very greatful & loving tone. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 Narciso states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrifice."" Narciso's parents left everything they ever had behind, to make his life easier. This whole excerpt is thanking them. Also, in paragraph @NUM2 Narciso ends with ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote shows how much he loves them. He could've had a big house where his family lived, but it wouldn't be home. Instead, he had a small house where everybody shared things. He could really call it home.In the excerpt Narciso Rodriguez the author sets the tone of gretfulness & loving. I can relate to this story because it reminds me of my family."
