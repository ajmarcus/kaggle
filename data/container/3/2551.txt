"The obstacle the builders had in attempting to allow dirigibles or ""blimps"" to dock on the Empire State Building were nature itself. The reason nature is the obstacle for blimps to dock on the building is because the wind currents moving the end of the blimp. If the blimp is moving by the wind while passangers are leaving or getting in, it would be very easy to fall off. Another obstacle the builders had with docking the blimps is the lead weights dangling from the end of the blimps. Those weights were used to keep the blimp from shifting directions due to the wind currents but it was a concern for the safety of the Street Pedestrians. On @CAPS1 @NUM1 of ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lsted, it quotes that ""... that using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above Pedestrians on the Street, was neither practical nor safe"". This quote proves that putting weights on the back of the blimp would be dangerous. If they some how fall off then someone could get really hurt on the streets."
