"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1 faced many problems with the attempt to allow blimps to dock their. One problem was that the already constructed frame was not strong enough for a new mooring mast for blimps. A second problem is shown in the quote ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents..."" (LŸsted para. @NUM1). The weather at the height of the Empire State building would throw and move blimps in violent ways when trying to dock. The push of the winds even caused the threat of blimp being blown into a spire on a surrounding building, the threat is shown in the quote ""which would puncture the dirigibles shell"" (LŸsted para @NUM2). That is what could happen if a blimp tried to tether to the building. The builders also faced the laws about flying that low over an urban area. All in all the builders of the Empire state building did face a many problems while trying to allow blimps access to the building."
