"In the excerpt the obstacles the @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the ""lack of a suitable landing area"". (p. @NUM1) @CAPS1 were trying to attempt a suitable landing area to allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and let passengers off and on. @CAPS1 try to attempt an electric winch. This ""would swing in the breeze and yet passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking gangplank to an open observation platform."" The biggest obstacle, @CAPS1 of the Empire State building was to ""nature itself"" which meant that dirigibles moored in open landing fields, where they would be high above pedestrians on the street where it was neither practical nor safe. @CAPS1 of the Empire State attempted these causes to allow dirigibles to enter on the property of the Empire State Building!"
