"Many obstacles were confronted when attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building. Such as the danger of the non-U.S dirigibles docking. The problem with that is they used hydrogen instead of helium, causing them to be highly flammable. They thought about when the German dirigible crashed and realized how much worse it would be if it happened in downtown New York. Another issue being nature's wind force. The wind on top of the Empire State Building was always aggresively shifting. Plus using lead weights like they do when landing in the fields would be hazard for the people below. Finally the law was a issue. The law stated that it was illegal to fly this low over urban areas. Though two dirigibles attempted they both experienced first hand the dangers of it."
