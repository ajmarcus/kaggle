The hot day in June riding a bike in the desert. The cyclist rode off into the sun on his way to Yosemite National Park. The old men told him where to go on the map even though they had not been through that way in years. When the cyclist started his day off ready to go. He thought he would be able to stop and get water regulary but as he found out he was in the middle of the desert with no water around. The man pushed himself and stopped thinking about water. He even put pebbles in his mouth to suck on so he would be able to keep his mind off water. The man was very smart in this situation and knew what to do. This experence has made him stronger.
