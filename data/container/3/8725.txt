"Home The Blueprints of our Lives is a warm tribute to the parents of Narciso Rodriguez. The author of this memoir had said, ""Growing up in this environment istilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Narciso Rodriguez would change the way a reader would perceive this memoir. It would be a story of a young child who has perceived the physical and mental qualities of adults. @CAPS1 acknowledges the troubles @CAPS1 and his parents are in. For his neighborhood including his family being immigrants, in a time of racism and segregation, @CAPS1 learned how to appreciate this ""close-knit community of honest, hard-working immigrants.""@CAPS1 understood how to Narciso Rodriguez Sr, and @ORGANIZATION2 struggled personally and financially. @CAPS1 became grateful for his opportunity to live in this Cuban home of Newark, New Jersey. Though his parents had worked in a laboratory and studied chemical engineering, they struggle to find work in financial times. @CAPS1 adores them. The author writes, ""They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" Without these relationships, and the lives of various people, this memoir would be a selfish story of a child. @CAPS1 appreciates everything the family has done. There was too much generosity impressed upon a boy of such an early age. @CAPS1 had learned how to respect his parents. In the end, Narciso Rodriguez would write a memoir devoted to the bonds @CAPS1 created with his parents and the refugees amongst them."
