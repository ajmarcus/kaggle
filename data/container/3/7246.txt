"The @CAPS1 in this memoir is joy and happiness. There is also caring and selflessness. This memoir describes how @ORGANIZATION1 grew up and his meaning of family. His family was very genorous to the people in their @CAPS2. On paragraph @NUM1 it says ""countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone Staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet"". His family was (seemed) very giving to their community. Because of Narciso's culture and family values, they have impacted his life today.Narciso parents were selfless. They would give up their living space to a friend who was having a hard time. They always had more then @NUM2 people at the dinner table and always more then @NUM2 people staying at their house. All these events have left Narciso Rodriguez with a sense of pride in his family and community."
