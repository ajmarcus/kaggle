"I think the memoir is a thankful and grateful mood. The author is grateful that she has parents that moved to @LOCATION1 for her. Also she is grateful that the simple place she lives in feels like a home. This says so in the last sentence ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Also Narciso is thankful in paragraph @NUM1 ""my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly as many imagrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in the country they loved."" @CAPS1 how thankfull Narciso seems to her parents who sacrificed their whole life for her. If that was me writing that story I would make the mood very grateful towards my parents."
