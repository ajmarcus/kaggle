"In the story, Winter Hibiscus, the author concludes his story with an odd ending. when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself,in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus budding. then I will take that test again. I believe that beyond the literal meaning the author is showing how Saeng is adapting to the new country. By failing her drivers test she also failed in adapting and accepting the new country By vowing to try again it also shows that she is willing to give the country another chance. She found she was still too shaky to say the words at home.. I believe that this is showing that she still didnt consider this country her home. She was still stuck on her past.       "
