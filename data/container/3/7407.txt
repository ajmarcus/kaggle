He said that, ""family"", was a great thing in that he learned the real definition. He said that he is most grateful for his caring and selfnassless parents. Narisco wrote about how you don't have to be a blood relative, to be family. He said that he is also grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. He said they showed him their lives and those teachings have been the basis of his life. He talked about his culture and how the heart of his home is his kitchen. He loves cooking and his parents taught him how to cook. He also said that in his neighborhood, cultures came together and there was unity and friendship. That was the mood created by the author in the memoir."
