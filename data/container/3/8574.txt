For example it said in the memory that his parents would be excellent cooks that passed it down to him. @CAPS2 that they would have the time to teach him and learn. Next, he loved his parent so much. For instance, it says ""I will always be geateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 he didn't love them he woldn't be saying thoughs things.
