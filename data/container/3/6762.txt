The greenhouse provided a place for her to get her feelings out about her home sickness, Òand in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.Ó Then when she went home she was faced with the reality again of how she failed the test. I think when she failed the test it brought out feelings of how she thinks she is failing to adjust her new home. But when the geese fly by the author brought the story to a conclusion to show how the experience has made Saeng grow. ÒWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again.Ó I think the author wanted to show that through the events in the story, she was able to overcome her feelings about a new home.
